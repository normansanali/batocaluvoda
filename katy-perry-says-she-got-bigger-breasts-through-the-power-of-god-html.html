Part of that image is sensuality. Perry has no qualms with showing off her body in <a href=#>music videos</a> and photoshoots.</p><p id=par-2_22>Perry thinks there’s something very special about her body. Something supernatural. Here’s why she thinks <a href=#>God</a> helped give her a curvaceous body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covergirl-katy.jpg><h2>A little on Katy Perry’s religious background</h2><p id=par-3_32><a href=#>Perry</a> was raised in a <a href=#>Christian</a> household. She still has a <a href=#>tattoo</a> of Jesus’ name on her hand which she looks at every time she performs.&nbsp;Perry said she still <a href=#>prays regularly</a>.</p><p id=par-4_57>Perry may not currently identify with Christianity or any other religion, but she does feel that she has a close connection with God. She even said <a href=#>God</a> once spoke to her prior to her Super Bowl performance. Perry says that, before the performance, God assured her she could nail the performance and that He would help her.</p><p id=par-5_52>In addition, Perry’s art is filled with religious references. These range&nbsp; from the biblical allusions in “Wide Awake” to the New Age symbolism of the “Never Really Over” video to the lyric about Buddhist mantras in “Legendary Lovers.” She even said in 2018 she will likely return to her Christian faith someday.</p><h2>Prayer and Katy Perry’s body</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>The video for Katy Perry’s “California Gurls”</figure><p id=par-6_45><a href=#>Prayer</a> has had an impact on Perry’s life. She sees her breasts as a literal godsend. She recalled an interesting anecdote from her early years about praying for God to change her body. Perry discussed a time when she prayed at the age of 11.</p><p id=par-7_57>Perry said “I lay on my back one night and looked down at my feet, and I prayed to God. I said, ‘God, will you please let me have boobs so big that I can’t see my feet when I’m lying down?’ God answered my prayers. I had no clue they would fall into my armpits eventually.”</p><p id=par-8_45>Perry sees the fact that her body is all-natural as validating her self-empowerment anthems. “I’ve never had any plastic surgery. Not a nose, not a chin, not a cheek, not a t*t. So my messages of self-empowerment are truly coming from an au naturel product.”</p><h2>Katy Perry comments on other artists mixing the sacred and the sexual</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Madonna performing on a glittery cross.</figure><p id=par-9_47><a href=#>Perry’s anecdote</a> could be understood as her mixing spirituality with sexuality. Interestingly, Perry once condemned the juxtaposition of those two concepts. In her video for “Alejandro,” Lady Gaga mixed Catholic symbolism with some highly sexual imagery. Soon after, Perry tweeted that using “blasphemy as entertainment” is “cheap.”</p><p id=par-10_35>Many Gaga fans took this comment as an attack on Gaga alone. Perry insisted she was not making a statement specifically about Gaga. Rather, she says she was commenting on pop culture as a whole.</p><p id=par-11_48>Perry commented on Gaga’s video as well as the time Madonna controversially performed on a cross. She said those are likely not the sorts of things she would do, given her background. However, she diplomatically said she was still a huge fan of both Gaga and Madonna.</p><p id=par-12_13><strong>Also see:</strong> <strong><a href=#>How Katy Perry’s ‘Tight, Sexy’ Dress Inspired a Britney Spears Hit</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4osDYZqeeqqKuerSt2KxkrKCVYrSwwIyboKCflad6o77Emqqtq12ptbO71KCfZqyYmnqxu9aeqWanlmK0sLCNoaumpF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
