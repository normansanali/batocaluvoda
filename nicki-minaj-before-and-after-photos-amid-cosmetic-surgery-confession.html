No surgery. No wigs. Just a brand new Colgate smile”.</p><p id=epVshoXjsCp data-wc=54>She reflected on her younger self: "I didn’t like being skinny, having a flat butt, you know. Having boobs that didn’t sit high enough. It was a lot of things," she continued. "And when I look back at myself now, I literally was like, ‘Oh, I’m about to look like that girl again.’ ”</p><p id=e_D23BTDkX data-wc=35>“The reason why I wasn’t able to look back at my old photos was I didn’t like the way I looked, right, physically, and now I love the way that person looks physically”, she added.</p><p id=eRKCPY76am data-wc=40>The rapper suggested that becoming a mother might have influenced her change in perspective as “seeing my son did remind me of myself so much. My real self. And it made me think why didn’t I like this? So weird.”</p><p id=eyvJHH5VUmP data-wc=26>Last year Nicki shared a before and after photo of herself from 2008 to 2022 to show fans how her looks have changed over the years.</p><p id=eOVVJtkbxC3 data-wc=52>Fans have speculated over the years about what work the ‘Barbie Tings’ star has had done, and while she’s not given an exhaustive list of her physical appearance changes, she mentioned on the Joe Budden podcast in March 2022 that in the early days she "never had surgery. I had ass shots."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e48yi_BRPw data-wc=20>Similarly, in August 2023 she<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;revealed</a> that after the birth of her son Papa Bear she got a breast reduction.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebFwuI6sS-j data-wc=21>"Nature did what they had to do for Papa Bear," she told City Girls rapper JT in an Instagram live stream.&nbsp;</p><p id=ea_YYLDAlQ data-wc=43>"I'm not gonna lie, somebody did tell me to get my boobs taken off, like a female in the industry, and I was like, 'No, no, not yet, not yet.'
