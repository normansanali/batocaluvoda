The sequel was set to begin filming in Paris and the Caribbean in August 2021 with Jeremy Garelick hired as director from a script written by James Vanderbilt.</p><p>At the September 2021 Tudum Global Fan Event, Sandler and Aniston officially announced that they would be back for another season. Mark Strong, Mélanie Laurent, Jodie Turner-Smith, Kuhoo Verma, Enrique Arce, Tony Goldwyn, Annie Mumolo and Zurin Villanueva will be joining the film alongside returning cast members Adeel Akhtar and John Kani from the first film.</p><h2><strong>What is Murder Mystery 2 Release Date?</strong></h2><p>The sequel to Jeremy Garelick and James Vanderbilt’s hit murder comedy Murder Mystery will hit theatres in the United States this fall. Both Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston return for this sequel to 2019’s Murder Mystery. <strong>On March 31, 2023,<a href=# rel=noopener> Netflix</a> plans to release Murder Mystery 2.</strong></p><p><strong>You can also read these posts related to upcoming series on Netflix:</strong></p><h2>The Trailer of Murder Mystery 2 was Released by Netflix</h2><p>If you’ve been holding out for a trailer for Murder Mystery 2, your wait is over. In case you haven’t heard, Netflix just dropped the official trailer for their mystery comedy and it’s hilarious. And it’s not just because the song “Bang Bang” by Ariana Grande, Jessie J and Nicki Minaj is playing in the background.</p><p><strong>Take a look at the teaser we’ve provided below:</strong></p><p></p><p>In the opening scene, a van crashes into a cafe, shattering a window and Nick and Audrey who have no idea what’s happening poke their heads out. The clip then shows the Spitzes heading to the destination wedding of the Maharaja, the scenes change into a picturesque island and the colorful setting of a lavish Indian wedding, unfortunately (for them) punctuated by a dead body.</p><p>Once that point is reached, things can only get wackier, wilder and funnier. Their trip ends in disaster, as it usually does because they are this couple. Nick and Audrey will once again be working with both friendly and unfriendly new faces, but that is the only difference this time around.</p><p>But other than that, the upcoming sequel will feature the same comedic action, high-speed chases and a lot of comedy of errors as the original.
