It also means that the amount of times I have to visit the grocery store has tripled in my attempt to keep my pantry stocked. So, I &nbsp;am always trying to whip up some sort of treat and this caramel corn has to be one of the all-time most requested. It is the ultimate ooey, gooey soft homemade caramel popcorn that is sweet and soft and very different than the hard stuff you find in the store.</p><p>My daughter’s darling friend, Cassidy is always coming over to the house and since she has to eat gluten-free, we have to be creative with our sweet offerings. &nbsp;A few years ago, we discovered that she could eat caramel popcorn so we made this for her and it was hook, line, and sinker! She became obsessed with this stuff.</p><p>Have you ever heard of the Pavlov theory? &nbsp;If you haven’t, you must look it up because it completely rings true in this situation. &nbsp;Cassidy walks through my front door and immediately thinks caramel popcorn…I must have caramel popcorn!&nbsp; I tease her all the time about how she can’t step foot in my house without salivating over this ooey, gooey caramel goodness. My kids love it when she comes over because they get to dig in and eat it too. I even found sweetened condensed milk on clearance at Sam’s Club and the crazy baker in me thought that I better stock up on this “heaven in a can” so I bought a ridiculous amount of it. &nbsp;I had to be prepared for Cassidy’s cravings (and my daugther’s as well)!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cassidys-Caramel-Corn-2.jpg alt="Cassidy's Caramel Corn.

First, you pop your own popcorn from scratch. Popcorn makers aren’t very expensive and are such a good investment. <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00006IUWA data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Here is a popcorn popper for about $20 bucks.</a></p><p>If you’ve never had coconut oil popcorn, you are missing out. Now, there is a way out if you don’t have a popcorn machine and that is to use plain ol microwave popcorn and it still does the trick.</p><p>Second of all, you make a caramel from scratch using butter, brown sugar, and round it out with sweetened condensed milk to make it creamy, rich, and utterly sinful. I could eat sweetened condensed milk by the spoonful. Anyone else with me?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSC_0574ed.jpg alt="Cassidy's Classic Caramel Corn" width=3008 height=2911 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=974 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/cassidys-classic-caramel-corn/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=3.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12003-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Pop popcorn kernels and place in large bowl.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12003-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=5><p>Place butter, brown sugar, and Karo syrup in medium saucepan over medium heat.
