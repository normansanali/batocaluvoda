He did attempt to mount something of a comeback in Netflix series The Pentaverate where he played eight roles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but the fact it was widely-panned and hardly made a dent on the streamer‚Äôs charts </a>hints that a renewal is unlikely.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Many reasons have been put forth as to why Myers decided to virtually drop off the face of the earth, and one of the most compelling to emerge recently is down to the fact he‚Äôs reportedly an asshole. That ball got rolling on Twitter, where a security guard who worked on The Love Guru claimed that he was fired for daring to make direct eye contact with the leading man, which then led to countless others touting their own tales of what working with the Austin Powers favorite was really like.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>People saying that ‚Äúhe shouldn‚Äôt be praised for helping‚Äù have no idea what it‚Äôs like working in film.
