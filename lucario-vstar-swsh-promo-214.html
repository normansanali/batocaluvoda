All valid registrants were entered into a lottery to allocate positions, the results of which were announced after each entry period closed. The first set of Lucario HR Competitions was held between September 30 and October 31; the second set was held between November 1 and 30; the third set was held between December 1 and 31.<a href=#>[1]</a> A maximum of 16 places were available per day at each event.<a href=#>[2]</a> Entrants received ten <a href=# title="Incandescent Arcana (TCG)">Incandescent Arcana</a> booster packs and a promotional <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Barry (S-P Promo 303)">Barry</a> <a href=# title="Supporter card (TCG)">Supporter card</a> upon paying the entry fee; 12 copies each of basic <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Grass Energy (TCG)">Grass</a>, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Fire Energy (TCG)">Fire</a>, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Water Energy (TCG)">Water</a>, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Psychic Energy (TCG)">Psychic</a>, and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Metal Energy (Basic)">Metal Energy</a> were also loaned to them.

Each Lucario HR Competition consisted of up to four 4-player round-robin qualifying rounds with the top player from each group going on to compete in a 4-player single-elimination tournament. Those reaching the single-elimination tournament were given a copy of a <a href=# title="Full Art card (TCG)">Full Art</a> <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Lucario V (S-P Promo 304)">Lucario V</a>, while the overall winners of a Lucario HR Competition were given a copy of the Rainbow Rare print of this card.<a href=#>[1]</a></p><p>An invitation-only Lucario HR Competition consisting of eight celebrities was conducted on September 23, 2022 to decide the first winner of the Rainbow Rare Lucario VSTAR. The tournament was livestreamed on <a href=# title=YouTube>YouTube</a>, during which people could participate in a couple of <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Twitter>Twitter</a> viewer campaigns. The Winner Prediction Campaign invited people to guess which celebrity would win the tournament, requiring them to Tweet a message of support to their chosen celebrity with the hashtag #ポケカオールスターズ, <i>Pokéca All Stars</i>. The Programme Quiz Campaign invited people to answer a question posed during the broadcast, requiring them to Tweet their answer using the same <i>Pokéca All Stars</i> hashtag (the answer was "ジャローダ", <i>Serperior</i>). Both campaigns required entrants to follow the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Twitter>Twitter</a> accounts of the official <a href=# title="Pokémon Card Channel">Pokémon Card Channel</a> and its presenters Raichu Umekawa, Nanapple, Kucheat Takeuchi, and Yopifoot. The Winner Prediction Campaign was open from the beginning of the broadcast until a break during the tournament; the Programme Quiz Campaign was open from the moment the question was first broadcast until the end of September 25, 2022. For each campaign, valid Tweets were entered into a lottery to win one copy of the Full Art Lucario V and one copy of the Rainbow Rare print of this card. No one entrant could win both prizes and winners were intended to be notified by early October 2022.<a href=#>[3]</a></p><p>The Rainbow Rare print could also be obtained through the Sealed Battle at Home Campaign, which similarly ran from September 30 until December 31, 2022.<a href=#>[4]</a> The intention of the campaign was to emulate physical Lucario HR Competitions by using the same resources in a home-based game. People wishing to take part were required to complete an application form on the Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website detailing their Player ID, registered email address, and a valid code for the deck they used, which could be obtained by building it in the Deck Construction section of the site. Only one entry per person would be accepted. All valid applicants were entered into a lottery to win one of the 6,000 prizes on offer—2,000 of these were a copy of the Rainbow Rare print of this card (prize A); 4,000 of these were a copy of the Full Art Lucario V (prize B).<a href=#>[4]</a></p><p>A <a href=# title="Full Art card (TCG)">Full Art</a> print with artwork by <a href=# title=Hncl>hncl</a> was later released as another SWSH Black Star Promo with the collection number SWSH291.
