LeGrand also has a sister named Nicole LeGrand Harrigan.</p><p>In 2008, he joined the Rutgers University football team. Eric made his collegiate debut against the North Carolina Tar Heels in September 2008.</p><p>On October 16, 2010, LeGrand suffered an injury in the fourth quarter during a collision with Army’s kickoff returner, Malcolm Brown, in a game against the Army Black Knights at MetLife Stadium. He later recalled:</p><p><strong>”I fell to the ground and my body just went, ‘ding.’ That’s all I hear, like my bell was ringing and I — my body was stuck. I try to get up but I couldn’t.”</strong></p><p>He lay motionless on the field before being carted off by doctors for about seven minutes. Then, Eric was rushed to Hackensack University Medical Center, where doctors diagnosed a C3-C4 injury. He said in an interview:</p><p><strong>”I sustained a spinal cord injury at the most crucial level, and was given less than a 5 percent chance of regaining neurological function. I was on a ventilator.”</strong></p><p>Doctors said that LeGrand would never again breathe without a ventilator. However, five weeks later, he started to breathe on his own. He also recovered his movement in his shoulders. In his words:</p><p><strong>”I have recovered movement in my shoulders, my trunk. I have full range of motion in my neck. And even get some fingers to twitch every now and then.”</strong></p><p>LeGrand went on to say:</p><p><strong>”Every day, I’m hopeful for more breakthroughs, which is why it is so important to keep focused on the future and advancing research for spinal cord injuries.”</strong></p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28690 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Eric-LeGrand-quotes.jpg.webp alt="Eric LeGrand quotes" width=1222 height=813 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Eric-LeGrand-quotes.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28690 class=wp-caption-text>Image source – © Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>Eric spent five months as a patient at Kessler Institute in West Orange.</p><p>One year after being paralyzed, Eric was confident he will walk again. He said for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a>:</p><p><strong>”I believe I will walk again. I do. When that happens, I already know what I’m going to do.”</strong></p><p>Eric continued:</p><p><strong>”I’ll go to Giants Stadium and find the exact spot in the field where I went down. I’ll lie there for a second. And then I’ll get up on my own power and walk away.”</strong></p><h2><strong>Life After Injury</strong></h2><p>LeGrand has since become a sports radio talk show host as well as a motivational speaker.</p><p>In May 2012,&nbsp;Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed LeGrand to a symbolic contract as an undrafted free agent.</p><p>In June 2012, he was presented the Unsung Hero Award by the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In the same year, LeGrand received the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the ESPYs.</p><p>In 2013, it was announced that the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights will be retiring the No. 52 jersey worn by Eric.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28691 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Eric-LeGrand-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Eric LeGrand Net Worth" width=1222 height=813 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Eric-LeGrand-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28691 class=wp-caption-text>Image source – © Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>From 2016–2017, he hosted a six-episode mini web series, titled – ”Mission Possible with Eric LeGrand.” The episodes included appearances from:</p><ul><li>Triple H;</li><li>Tom Brady;</li><li>Frank Lampard;</li><li>Bill Belichick;</li><li>Michael Strahan;</li><li>Drew Brees;</li><li>Justin Thomas;</li><li>Dwayne Johnson;</li><li>Sean Payton.</li></ul><p>In 2017, Eric was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as the 3rd recipient of the Warrior Award.</p><h2><strong>Books</strong></h2><p>In 2012, LeGrand published two books – ”Believe: My Faith and the Tackle That Changed My Life” and ”Believe: The Victorious Story of Eric LeGrand Young Readers’ Edition.”</p><p>In these books, he tells the uplifting story of how he is rebuilding his future with faith.</p><h2><strong>Takes Girl To Prom</strong></h2><p>In 2016, he attended the Hanover Park High School prom night with Gianna Brunini, an 18-year-old girl diagnosed with cerebral palsy (a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle tone or posture) at age 2, who befriended Eric at a Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation. He said:</p><p><strong>”She had me on the dance floor the entire night. I’m all tired. I was out there with those 17-year-old kids.”</strong></p><p>Eric also said:</p><p><strong>”I was her date, so I just followed her, and we were out there boogieing all night.”</strong></p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p>”I believe it. God has a plan for me, and I know it’s not to be sitting here all the time. I know he has something planned better for me.”</p><p>”I always tell people that this injury doesn’t discriminate. It can happen to anyone at any given moment, whether it is a car accident or a sports injury, or gun violence or falling off a ladder.”</p><p>”I’ve always been that happy-go-lucky, life of the Party want to be around guy. My entire life, I’ve always been like that. And when I got hurt, I said I wasn’t going to let this injury define me.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=#>Is Jay Williams Married?</a></p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p>In 2012, the former Rutgers football star-turned-national-inspiration tweeted ”Want to race me” to Lolo Jones, an American hurdler and bobsledder who won gold medals at the World Indoor Championship in 2008 and 2010.</p><p>Lolo tweeted back:</p><p><strong>“Get checked for a concussion. clearly u’ve been hit in the head … cos u arent beating a track athlete.”</strong></p><p>But, as Lolo says, it was a mistake – she didn’t know anything about Eric. She later released the following statement:</p><p><strong>”I’m truly sorry if I offended anyone by my tweet. When Eric challenged me to a race earlier all I knew was that he was a football player, but certainly had no idea he had become paralyzed from a football injury.”</strong></p><p>Lolo Jones added:</p><p><strong>”I thought I was tweeting in good fun like I always do with the many athletes who challenge me to races.”</strong></p><p>Eric later tweeted: “didn’t take it personal, understand where ur coming from. All good.”</p><p>In 2019, he started to sell shirts in commemoration of National Disability Employment Awareness Month. The shirts say, ”Roll Model.” The “O” in “Roll” is created to look like a person in a wheelchair. Eric said, ”I designed these … and a part of the proceeds are going back to the Christopher and Dana Reeves Foundation to find a cure for paralysis.”</p><p>Rutgers Scarlet Knight created a fund named “bELieve.” All the proceeds are going to LeGrand and his family.</p><p><span style=font-weight:700!important>READ MORE:&nbsp;</span><a href=#>Inky Johnson Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Eric LeGrand – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>LeGrand earns money from his sponsors and donations.
