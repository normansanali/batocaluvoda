Before they became an item, the pair had crossed paths several times.&nbsp;The Culpo Sisters actress was asked how she met Braxton during an Instagram Q&A in January. According to the New York Post, the model stated that they had “a number of weird run-ins” before the meeting, including during her sister Aurora’s bachelorette party.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sophia-Culpo-1.jpg alt="Sophia Culpo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Braxton Berrios, who was born on October 6, 1995, is an NFL wide receiver for the New York Jets. Braxton attended Miami University and was a standout athlete at Leesville Road High School in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he played quarterback. The New England Patriots selected him in the sixth round of the 2018 NFL Draft.&nbsp;Berrios is expected to be re-signed by the Jets in March 2022 to a two-year, $12 million contract with a $7 million guarantee.</p><p>Sophie was often seen cheering for Braxton during his games. Although she knew very little about the game, her partner taught her a lot, and she is now in a much better position. She told E! News about the caliber of her partner:</p><p>“He’s an excellent instructor with a lot of patience, considering I knew nothing about football before meeting him.”</p><p>Aside from cheering each other on, the pair enjoys “cooking and going for walks together.” Sophia is overjoyed to have Braxton in her life since he loves her with all his heart. She stated:</p><p>“I have to add that since meeting my boyfriend, he’s been a huge source of support for me since he’s honestly like my closest friend and I can tell him anything and he’ll look at me with 10,000 zits on my face and think I’m gorgeous.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sophia-Culpo.jpg alt="Sophia Culpo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The reality TV personality went on to say:</p><p>“Finding a relationship and someone in whom you can genuinely trust and confide has helped me a lot on my own path and in being more secure in myself.”</p><p>Sophia will now introduce her partner to The Culpo Sisters fans. He will, however, only appear in a few episodes. According to the New York Post, she commented regarding his performance on The Culpo Sisters:</p><p>“He appears in one or two episodes, but not all of them.” We try to balance long distance a little bit, so he appears in certain episodes but not all of them.”</p><p>TLC will telecast The Culpo Sisters on Monday, November 7, at 9 p.m. ET. The program is also available on Discovery+.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmasmJp6pMHLqaZmq5mowaa%2B0maqrZmiYsCwvMeimGabpaG9sHnAp5tmmqKWxbW7zWaZnqqinry0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
