According to <a href=#>Spin</a>, at only 22 years old, the singer "already had one gold and two platinum albums to her credit," while also embarking on what was to be a fruitful career as an actor, too. Simply put, Aaliyah was at the peak of her success.</p><p dir=ltr>With three albums under her belt, in August of 2001, Aaliyah jetted off to the Bahamas to film a music video for her single, "Rock the Boat," per <a href=#>Rolling Stone.</a> As revealed by VH1's "<a href=#>Behind the Music</a>," the singer was "anxious" to first board the plane heading to Abaco Island, yet reluctantly agreed. Aaliyah's boyfriend, Damon Dash, told "<a href=#>The Real</a>" in 2016, "She was like, 'I don't like that plane ... It was a complicated situation, but she had to go do that video."</p><p dir=ltr>Sadly, Aaliyah's fears came true. On August 25, the singer and her crew were prepped to head back to Florida, boarding a 10-seat twin-engine Cessna 402B. Under a minute after takeoff, the plane crashed, with Aaliyah killed instantly (via Rolling Stone). According to <a href=#>MTV</a>, the music video's director, Hype Williams, still released "<a href=#>Rock the Boat</a>," hoping Aaliyah's fans "would enjoy it." Noting the obvious "pain" of the final product, he added, "that's all the more reason people would appreciate what we've done as a group."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kW5rbm1fosK0tcKimKerXay1sHnPq5ydoZOpsqV506GcoqpdpMSvecOemK2go2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
