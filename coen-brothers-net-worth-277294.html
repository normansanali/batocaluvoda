They are perhaps best known as film directors, screenwriters, producers of such hits as Raising Arizona, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. The Coen Brothers began their attempt at movie-making as children. Their first camera was a Vivitar Super 8, which Joel purchased using money he saved from mowing lawns. In 1984, the brothers wrote and directed Blood Simple, their first film together. The film received much praise and won awards at both the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards. In 1987, the film Raising Arizona put the brothers on the map with this story of an unlikely married couple (ex-convict H.I. played by Nicolas Cage and police officer Ed played by Holly Hunter) who long for a baby but are unable to conceive.</p><p>The Coen Brothers often cast certain actors in their films; most frequently Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, John Goodman, Jon Polito and John Turturro. Ethan and Joel have each been nominated for many Academy Awards and have won several. Twelve nominations were joint nominations, but each received individual nominations for the film Fargo. Joel married actress Frances McDormand (who starred in Fargo) in 1984 and they adopted a son from Paraguay named Pedro. Ethan married film editor Tricia Cooke and they had daughter Dusty and son Buster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTpLKvecGrpq2glafAbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2BlnBpcmw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
