He can’t quite manage many of the stunts he took on in his youth, but the 80-year-old actor still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performs many of his stunts</a> in this month’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</a></strong>. That’s impressive all on its own, but far cooler when the actor’s history with stunts is considered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-1-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/indiana-jones-5-6.jpg><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Many people, including Ford’s stunt double from all three <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">original Indiana Jones flicks</a>, have noted the actor’s affinity for stunt work. His longtime stunt double, Vic Armstrong, even pulled him aside at one point during filming for The Last Crusade, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, to urge him to back off a bit. He was so focused on doing his own stunts that Armstrong was forced to urge the star to let him “do some work” for the film, a trend that apparently started with Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>A quote from Armstrong only reinforces this idea. The stellar stuntman was quick to praise Ford’s performance, noting that “If he wasn’t such a great actor, he would have made a really great stuntman.”</p><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=false>Ford echoed a similar sentiment toward Armstrong in a separate interview, following years of suffering from mistaken identity. Armstrong reportedly looks so much like Ford that the two were often <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mistaken for one another</a> during filming for all three original <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones flicks</a>, and it became an ongoing joke among the cast and crew. So much so, in fact, that Ford referenced it in a message to Armstrong at the conclusion of filming for The Last Crusade, writing “Vic, if you learn to talk I am in deep trouble” on a picture he signed for his longtime stunt man and friend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SutHnIrWStraKjwG671K1koZmip7a0u81mnaiqlGLEor%2BMrZ%2BeZZ%2Bntqi1zZqjZqyfonqkvtSiqp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
