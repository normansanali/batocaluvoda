Some of the supplies landed in Boston on April 2, 2020 after several weeks of preparation.</p><p>Kraft was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, to a Jewish family, one of four children of New England Patriots owner <a href=#>Robert Kraft</a> and his late wife Myra Kraft. <a href=#>Robert Kraft</a> is worth an estimated $4.8&nbsp;billion, according to Forbes and ranks as 108th richest person in 2015.

In March 2006, when the National Football League Players Association and the NFL were deadlocked in contract negotiations, Kraft designed the revenue sharing plan that was used for that version of the collective bargaining agreement.</p><p>Kraft also served as the owner/investor of the San Jose Earthquakes from 1999 to 2000, the two years which the Kraft Group owned the team.</p><p>Since their inception in 1995 as one of the inaugural teams of Major League Soccer, Kraft has been the co-owner/investor of the Revolution, along with his father. Foxboro hosted its third MLS Cup in 2002, the first in Gillette Stadium and the first involving the Revolution as one of the teams vying for the MLS title.

Foxboro Stadium played host to six matches of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, five of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, as well as the 2000 Founder's Cup. In November 2005, the Krafts expressed interest in purchasing the Liverpool F.C., but the team was eventually acquired by a pair including <a href=#>Tom Hicks</a>, the owner of the Dallas Stars and Texas Rangers, in February 2007.</p><p>Jonathan A.
