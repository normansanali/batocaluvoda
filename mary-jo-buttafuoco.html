Back then, he denied all the allegations of having any relationship with Fisher. Later, he was found guilty on several grounds and he admitted his sexual relationship with Amy Fisher.</p><p>Amy Fisher was still a minor when Joey started a relationship with her. Joey was also convicted based on having persuaded Amy Fisher to commit the crime and was charged with raping a minor and planning a murder.</p><p>Joey was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for being indicted on many counts of statutory rape, sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. Amy Fisher was convicted of an attempt to murder and was sentenced to seven years in jail.</p><p>Since she was a minor, she was kept in the juvenile room until she turned 18. After spending seven more years in jail, Fisher was released on parole in 1999 with the condition that she would never contact the Buttafuoco family again.</p><h4>On Media</h4><p>Overnight, the story became international news. Throughout 1992, the stories of the affair between the then-teenager Amy Fisher and her husband Joey filled the pages of tabloids. The heinous act became the most talked-about crime that year and is yet to fade away completely.</p><p>The crime became so famous that Fisher’s story was made into three TV films. Media also nicknamed Amy Fisher ‘The Long Island Lolita’.</p><p>In the year 2007, all three members of the fatal love triangle, Mary, Joey, and Amy, came together for an interview. She even stated that she had forgiven Fisher.

This made it impossible for her to smile for 25 years.</p><p>Even though she miraculously survived the close-range shot, she struggled with her deformed face for years. Her initial surgeries were too dangerous. For years after the initial surgeries, she was completely on painkillers, which made her an addict.</p><p>She showed up recovering when she was moved to the Betty Ford Center, where she had most of her surgeries. After many years, she recovered partially and was relieved from pain and blood clots.</p><p>However, she was still disfigured and paralyzed. A plastic surgeon named Dr. Babak Azizzadeh saw her on the Oprah Show and offered to treat her facial paralysis, but the ray of hope came with many challenges.</p><p>The main challenge for Dr. Azizzadeh was contouring while maintaining the symmetry of her face. He started with a facelift, an eyelift, and by repairing some of the nerves that had kept her from smiling.</p><p>Then, he focused on the surgery that would widen the ear canal which improved her hearing and prevented further infections. The journal, ‘Inside Edition’ documented the procedure. She also went through physical therapies to strengthen her facial muscles.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>At present, Mary is enjoying her single life. She married Stu Tendle on 25 February 2012. They had their wedding at Always and Forever Chapel in Las Vegas. Stu was a shop manager in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>The new-found love restored the courage to trust and to believe and with that, she once again found hope in a committed relationship with Stu after her life-changing incident. Sadly, Stu lost his life to cancer in the year 2018.</p><p>Before this, she was married to Joey Buttafuoco. They married on 4 September 1977 and their marriage lasted for over 26 years. The couple finalized their divorce on 3 February 2003 after going through heartbreaks and the shooting incident.</p><p>The then couple has two children together. They are daughter Jessica Buttafuoco and son, Paul Buttafuoco. Her daughter, Jessica, was only 9 years old at the time of her shooting incident.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32101 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mary-Jo-Buttafuoco-second-marriage.jpg alt="Mary Jo Buttafuoco" width=650 height=605 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-32101 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Mary Jo Buttafuoco during her marriage with Stu Tendler.
