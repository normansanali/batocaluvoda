It did seem like the two had buried the hatchet and called a truce for the sake of their unborn child after they reunited for a TikTok video earlier this week but that it doesn't seem like it anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>Lopez has also fathered Kailyn's youngest son, Lux, aged 2, along with the one yet to arrive and he recently posted a series of cryptic quotes related to parenting on his page.&nbsp;</p><p>A now-deleted story on his Instagram page read, "As a parent, you should be more concerned with your child’s happiness than your petty insecurities and jealousies. Just a thought.” He also wrote: “Ppl really need to grow up SMH. It’s really sad." The posts come after Lowry, posted a TikTok video of Lopez using her Pothead haircare products earlier this week.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Intouch Weekly</a>, the tension escalated when the pregnant 'Teen Mom 2' star, 28, saw one of her private maternity photos online on April 23 and she posted online about her shock. However, baby daddy Lopez allegedly said “he doesn’t believe the [photo] was leaked” in an Instagram Live video soon after. Lowry was livid at her ex's remarks and demanded that the photo be taken off from all domains.&nbsp; “My team and I have been made aware that a personal photo of me was posted online without my knowledge or permission,” the TV personality wrote on Twitter. “To say I am deeply saddened and humiliated, especially after the ill-advised posting of my previous maternity photo, is an understatement. I had no plans to release this photograph.”</p><p>In late 2019, Lowry filed a Protection From Abuse order against Lopez. Though a <a href=# rel=nofollow>media house</a> was unable to confirm the PFA order, a Delaware court clerk exclusively confirmed three cases against Lopez, all of which remain open. They were allegedly related to him breaking the restraining order Lowry took out against him. In January 2020, <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Ashley's Reality Roundup</a> reported that Lopez was arrested for allegedly violating the PFA.</p><p>In February, Lowry, who is also mom to son Isaac, 10, with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera and Lincoln, 6, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin, announced her pregnancy with Lopez. The latter and Lowry's relationship has continued to blow hot and cold since the birth of their son, Lux.&nbsp;</p><p>She told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a> at the time that she is raising her fourth son without Lopez and confirmed that they “have no contact.” She also said: "Legally, I’m not able to go into detail. Domestic violence and narcissism are very real subjects, and when I’m in the place to be able to offer advice, I will.”</p><p>Lowry continued: "At the end of the day, I have three children that are happy, healthy, and wonderful kids. I know I’m prepared to raise another baby on my own and we are all so excited to welcome him into our family."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorJWau265zqZka2Wjqa6zecqaoKWxnmK5sMPRsmScoKKewG64zqmcs2WWnrSpwIygqaivXaq9bsDIpKuoo12Yv7q806KaZqifqMG0ecinqq2Zl6eurg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
