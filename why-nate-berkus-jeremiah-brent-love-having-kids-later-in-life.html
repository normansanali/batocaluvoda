Every time.’ That’s something we always think about. When our kids come around the corner, we’re always excited to see them.”</p><p>Waiting to start a family doesn’t come without its cons, though. The Nate & Jeremiah By Design stars&nbsp;<a href=#>welcomed their daughter Poppy</a>, 4, in 2015, and she became a big sister when <a href=#>Oskar, 14 months,&nbsp;arrived</a> three years later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Nate-Berkus-Jeremiah-Brent-Love-Having-Kids-Later-in-Life-02.jpg><p>“They’re each their own individuals with their own personalities and own rhythm,” Brent&nbsp;said of the couple’s little ones. “You have to really figure out what they’re trying to communicate, craft the way you navigate them as parents around their personality.”</p><p>He and Berkus, who<a href=#> tied the knot in 2014</a>, <a href=#>are “done” having children</a> and enjoy spending time with their twosome. “We’re doing art all day,” Brent told Us. “Any opportunity for them to actually create something. Our daughter’s really artistic and our son’s still crawling so TBD.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Nate & Jeremiah By Design&nbsp;</i>airs Saturdays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGawoKliu6LAxGaZnqqbqsButsSrnKahkZ16o77Ep6tmpJ%2Brsm60wK%2Bgp59doLalv4ylmK2domK2r3nLop2eZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
