Anderson</strong>, on February 1. The couple, who wed in 2009, also share daughters Evers, 12, and Dashiel.</p><p>The Ukraine native announced that she and her husband were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expecting their third child together</a> in August 2019 after she suffered a miscarriage.</p><p>“Knocked up again,” Jovovich captioned a picture showing off her baby bump at the time. “After I found out I was pregnant 13 weeks ago, I had a mixture of feelings ranging between complete joy and utter terror. Because of my age and losing the last pregnancy I didn’t want to get attached to this potential baby too quickly.”</p><p>Osian’s first few weeks in the world didn’t come without some challenges. The actress revealed that her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">daughter was diagnosed with a “bad case” of jaundice</a>, a condition that causes yellowing of a baby’s skin and eyes, one week after she was born.</p><p>The family has also been practicing social distancing together amid the widespread coronavirus outbreak. The Hellboy star shared via Instagram on March 17 that she and her daughters<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“took a little family adventure”</a> to their garden to harvest some of the produce Jovovich has been growing.</p><p>Besides teaching her children to be sustainable, Jovovich also wants to make sure <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her kids never feel “entitled.” </a>The model told Us in February 2019 that she always want to maintain honest communication with her daughters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s about having an open conversation every time. Every time that I see my [eldest] daughter getting a bit complacent, feeling a little entitled and … treating people in a way that’s not totally respectful, I call and say, ‘Hey let’s stop and talk.’ … I tell her about what’s going on in the world, I tell her how lucky she is and to remember what’s important in this life,” Jovovich explained at the time.</p><p><i>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i><span class=markzyk4bw9lk data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Us</span><span class=marklzzdaew7v data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Weekly</span>&nbsp;</i><i>wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
