In the clip shared from DJ Akademiks' page, the 20-year-old rapper looks eager to share what he's been working on. However, fans seem divided on its quality. "This n*gga sounds the same in every song. He suffers from the dominque jones syndrome," one fan commented.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Those record company streaming bots is going to be the only things bumping this," another person wrote, whereas one fan offered a different perspective: "Ohhh brother i swear yall the same ones saying that music b sounding the same and when someone drops something a lil different from all the shit we hear yall say its trash. This song dont even sound terrible."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bnyx-has-worked-with-drake-lil-uzi-vert-among-others>BNYX Has Worked With <a href=# class=text-word>Drake</a>, <a href=# class=text-word>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, Among Others</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The track's reported producer BNYX (pronounced Benny X), has previously worked with several industry heavyweights. Among the artists on the list are Drake, Lil Uzi Vert, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a>, and more. It is unclear when the track will be released, but hopefully, the finished product will help fans decide whether they like it. Lil Tecca has yet to reveal anything else about the tune. The upcoming track has not been discussed by BNYX either.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this year, the rapper was roasted for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sampling Brandy and Monica's 90s hit, "That Boy Is Mine."</a> Overall, the sample contributes to a pretty woozy and low-key cut with minimal drum patterns that are mostly carried by Tecca’s vocal delivery. Unfortunately for him, fans are tired of sample songs being so prevalent and “mid” in today’s hip-hop landscape. Of course, sampling is nothing new in the genre, as much as people like to complain about their prolificacy. In fact, sampling is considered a foundation of hip-hop by most leading figures, fans, and other community members. However, there have been a lot of hit rap songs that use sampling as a way to boost their track’s profile or entice more listeners into tuning in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZYBzhJVmo6KkXamypK%2FAZquemaOawG6uzbKvZqiipLG2r8SdZK2qkZi4</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
