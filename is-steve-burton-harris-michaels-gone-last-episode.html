Not with a bang but a farewell? Actually, with him and Ava having a round of goodbye sex, maybe it is ending with a bang of sorts…</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Jessica Serfaty has always ‘wished for a moment like this’</a></p><p>Though we haven’t gotten official word on when Steve Burton would be exiting with Harris (he’s been airing over on General Hospital as Jason for some time now), he finished taping at Days of Our Lives shortly before the holidays. That would put his exit around now <span>—</span> and we may have just seen it in today’s episode.</p><p>Harris and Ava managed to get their hands on Clyde’s black book, turn it over to the Salem PD (with a little arm twisting help from Stefan, who wants Clyde gone as much as Ava), scan the pages and give them to Harris’ old Navy SEAL buddies. The plan is to come up with a way to crack the cipher and track Clyde down when the digital pages are sent to him. Though at this point, we feel like nothing short of killing Clyde will put an end to him. Actually, this is Salem, that probably wouldn’t do it either.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-1775-e1715265907851.jpg alt="Days' Steve is talking to Stefan in the DiMera living room, while Ava looks at him warily" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Harris, though, as of Thursday’s episode, is supposedly leaving to check on his “team” as they work to take Clyde down. He promised Ava he won’t be gone long and she, in turn, told him to hurry back, “because I’m gonna miss you like crazy.”</p><p>In other words, it seems just about as clear that he won’t return as a character in a horror movie leaving a room and announcing “I’ll be right back!”</p><p>At this point, he and Ava are all in, so it doesn’t seem like they’ll just break up and he’ll run off. The show could just have him leave and disappear (It wouldn’t be the first time. <a href=# rel=noopener>Don Craig, anyone?</a>), but if this is the end of Harris, we have a feeling something more permanent may happen. He could run off to play the hero offscreen and take Clyde down, only to be killed in the process.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/harris-ava-bed-days-jj.png alt="With blankets covering them, a seemingly naked Ava and Harris prop against the head board in bed" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>That would be kind of cruel for Ava who’s last beau, Jake, was gunned down on her, but no one ever said daytime was nice! We’ll have to wait and see, but at this point, we wouldn’t advise holding our breaths that we’ll be seeing Harris again. What we do know is that he seems to be gone for now!</p><p><strong>Keep track of what show Burton is on along with the rest of daytime with our comprehensive <a href=# rel=noopener>comings and goings photo gallery</a> here.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOnKamoZ6cwG6tzZ1koKeZo7S0e5ZsZ2lxYmS2tHnSrZyvnV2XwrPAzqdkoZmip7a0ecyimqGZlaHAbrPOp5xmpJGowW6xz6KqqJyVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
