From sex and drugs to womanizing and partying like crazy, it seems that in order to be a true part of the rock and roll scene, you need to fit some of that criteria. One legendary rocker who succeeds in that is The Rolling Stones frontman <a href=#>Mick Jagger.</a></p><p>Mick Jagger is one of the most famous rock and rollers in history, but he’s also a legendary dad. Because he's the father of eight kids, many fans are curious about his baby mamas too.

Karis’s mother is a woman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marsha Hunt</a>. She was Mick’s partner at the time.</p><p>Marsha is an American actress, novelist, singer, and former model. The two met when The Rolling Stones asked her to pose for an ad for their album "Honky Tonk Women.” According to Marsha, she refused to do it but later was called by Mick himself, and the two began their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Sanford's book Mick Jagger: Rebel Knight</a>, Marsha told journalist Frankie McGowan that Mick's awkwardness helped them connect but that they kept their relationship private because they ran in very different social circles. The two went their separate ways when Marsha was pregnant with Karis.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mick fathered his second child the very next year in 1971.</h2><p>Not wasting any time, Mick met Nicaraguan actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bianca Pérez-Mora Macías</a> just a few months after splitting from Marsha Hunt at a Rolling Stones concert after-party. In May 1971, while Bianca was four months pregnant with their daughter, the couple married in France.&nbsp;The couple's only child, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jade Jagger</a>, was born the following October in Paris.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In May 1978, she filed for divorce, claiming that Mick had been unfaithful during their marriage with a woman named Jerry Hall. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bianca later said</a>, "My marriage ended on my wedding day.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Speaking of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Hall</a>, Mick and Jerry met in 1977 and married in 1990 in Bali. Their marriage was actually deemed null due to London law. Mick had four children with the model — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia</a>, and Gabriel. Similar to his first wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry cited infidelity</a> as the reason for the dissolution of their relationship. The two parted in 1999.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mick’s seventh child was conceived while he was still with Jerry Hall.</h2><p>In 1999, Luciana Gimenez Morad, a Brazilian television host and former model, became pregnant with Mick’s child while he was still sort of married to Jerry. They <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially confirmed</a> that Lucas Maurice Morad-Jagger was, in fact, Mick’s seventh child with DNA tests.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mick is currently dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melanie Hamrick</a>, a choreographer and former ballerina at the American Ballet Theatre.
