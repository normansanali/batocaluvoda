A new interview suggests they knew Felicia had also recently lost her brother.</p><p>Toward the end of BB25, it was revealed that <a href=#>Felicia’s brother died while Big Brother was filming</a>. She decided to continue playing the game, and the topic was never addressed on the show.</p><p>Looking back on the season, the signs were there that Felicia was dealing with something, even though she didn’t speak about it to the live feed cameras.</p><p>Following the Big Brother 25 season finale, Felicia has been open about everything that took place during the 100-day season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-felicia-cannon-speaks-about-getting-isolated-on-big-brother-25>Felicia Cannon speaks about getting isolated on Big Brother 25</h2><p>In a new interview with Bounced Checks from Silent Podcasts, Felicia spent roughly three hours discussing the Big Brother 25 season.</p><p>In the clip below, Felicia references how she felt isolated in the house when only five people were left. She also tells a brief story about how she went to the kitchen with Jag, Matt, and Bowie Jane, but they wouldn’t speak to her.</p><p>Felicia also touches on another topic she claims production wouldn’t let her bring up in the house.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As she spoke more about her perceived isolation, she also touched on the other houseguests knowing about her brother’s passing.</p><p>This tidbit hadn’t been revealed before, as it had been assumed that Felicia was told, but she kept it to herself. She says that was not the case.</p><p>People watching the interview live were taken aback and posted about it on social media.</p><p>“I’m LIVID!!! The MFers knew about Miss Felicia brother’s passing!
