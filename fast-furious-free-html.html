The movie marks the beginning of the end of the main storyline in the franchise, with only two movies expected after this one. Since the pandemic delayed the release of the ninth movie up to this point, the studio wants to make sure fans are properly excited and ready to see it when it comes out. To that end, they’ve teamed up with movie theater chains across the United States in order to offer free Friday night screenings of the first eight movies in theaters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s been one helluva ride so far. Get ready for <a href=#>#F9</a> by watching all the movies in the Fast Saga on the BIG SCREEN. Every Friday in select theaters across the country starting 4/30. <a href=#>#FastFridayScreenings</a></p>— #F9 (@TheFastSaga) <a href=#>April 23, 2021</a></figure><p>Notice that their announcement says that you can catch the first eight Fast & Furious movies in “select” theaters. While they’ve teamed up with many chains, you’ll need to look on their website in order to discover if they’re available near you. And with so few showings, the free tickets will likely sell out fast. If you’re one of the lucky vaccinated audience members ready to catch up while you wait for the new movie, you’ll want to grab your tickets fast. The <a href=#>Fast Friday Screenings</a> website can help you find local theaters, but you’ll likely need to check in with your local theaters directly to see if they’re included.</p><p>The free screenings will happen every Friday night starting on April 30, 2021. This will end with the eighth movie on Friday, June 18, 2021. One week later, the brand new Fast & Furious 9 will release in theaters everywhere. That movie will require regularly priced movie tickets.</p><p>There are two things to note here. One: watching the main eight movies isn’t watching the entire franchise in order. If you want to enjoy a proper build-up to the ninth movie and watch every spin-off in <a href=#>the order</a> they’re meant to be seen, you’ll need to do some streaming at home during the week of the other films in the franchise. Two: you don’t have to have seen any Fast & Furious movies in order to understand a new one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fast-furious-7-900x506.jpg><p>Watching the previous movies is a great way to build excitement. The car chases and camaraderie among the crew make for easy light watching in this franchise. These movies have always just been fun. And that means that while you won’t know the full backstory of every relationship on screen if you just pick up a random Fast & Furious movie, you’ll still be able to understand and enjoy the movie. Of course, it would be a shame to skip any of them and miss things like the famous tank scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fast-furious-tank-scene-900x510.jpg><p>Watching them in order also lets you benefit from the way they’ve worked to build to more and more ludicrous ideas. There is nothing you should ever put past a Fast & Furious movie. The trailer for the upcoming film includes <a href=#>flying cars</a>. When asked if the car chase movies could ever include <a href=#>dinosaurs</a>, the minds behind the movies simply wouldn’t rule anything out. If you enjoy a movie willing to go as ridiculous as possible, then clearly catching up on these movies will be a good time for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iekajBbrLUq6CoraNis7OxxGefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
