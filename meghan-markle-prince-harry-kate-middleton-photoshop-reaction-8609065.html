Earlier this week, a source that claimed to be "close" to the couple spoke on their behalf about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Middleton's viral Mother's Day Photoshop flop</a>, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Page Six</a> that “this isn’t a mistake Meghan would ever make.” The supposed insider added that Harry and Meghan would&nbsp;“have been annihilated” if the situations were reversed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The same rules do not apply to both couples," they said. "This isn’t a mistake that Meghan would ever make … she has a keen eye and freakish attention to detail."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's official spokesperson refuted the Page Six source's statement while speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Newsweek</a>. “With respect to&nbsp;Page Six, that did not come from us.” That's not to say that the original quotes didn't come from a friend or someone close to their camp, but the couple made it clear that they had nothing to do with Page Six's article.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">British tabloids like the Daily Mail andTelegraph attempted to rope the Sussexes (and their friend and photographer Misan Harriman) into the mix by questioning the validity of their 2021 pregnancy announcement photo. Harriman shut down those claims by sharing an unedited version of the image on Instagram. He also shared a video addressing the accusation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Unfortunately, there’s been an article on the&nbsp;Daily Mail, saying that I have admitted to doctoring the pregnancy announcement portrait I took of Harry and Meghan,” he said. “Apparently, I was switching out trees and meadows. This is crazy.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone not on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate-Middleton-theories</a> side of TikTok, Middleton posted a seemingly innocent photo with her children for U.K. Mother's Day, which was then removed by photo agencies and outlets (like Associated Press) that claimed the "source has manipulated the image."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Middleton then <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>addressed the backlash</a> on Twitter, writing, "Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused," she wrote. "I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.
