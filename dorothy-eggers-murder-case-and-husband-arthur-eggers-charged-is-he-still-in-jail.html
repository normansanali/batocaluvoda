Although the head and hands had been sliced off, making identification difficult, the body had just been there for a day, so there was still hope.</p><p>Even though the initial report characterized Dorothy Eggers as being slimmer and taller than the unidentified body, authorities chose to pursue the lead after learning that she had been reported missing by her husband around the time the corpse was discovered.</p><p>Detectives learned from Eggers’ doctors that she had been treated for a bunion on her foot that resembled her body.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-husband-arthur-eggers-now></span>Where Is Husband Arthur Eggers Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arthur Eggers was at San Quentin Prison. On January 22nd, Eggers was arrested.</p><p>Even though investigators were aware of the victim’s identification and had grounds to suspect Arthur Eggers, they had no proof linking him to the crime.</p><p>However, when Eggers sold his car to a police officer, the officer spotted dried blood marks in the trunk, and Eggers was arrested in 1946.</p><p>Eggers’ home was later searched, and parts of his wife’s flesh, a rifle, and a handsaw were discovered. There were pieces of tissue, bone, and fat on the saw.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dorothy-eggers-wikipedia-details></span>Dorothy Eggers Wikipedia Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dorothy Eggers has no official page on Wikipedia.</p><p>Dorothy informed Arthur that the certificate proving their car ownership had been accidentally torched.</p><p>He secured an application for a duplicate certificate, which he “convinced” her to sign despite her “reluctance.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-dorothy-eggers-family></span>Meet Dorothy Eggers Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dorothy Eggers’s family includes parents and siblings. She has kept her parent’s identities private.</p><p>Marie, the eldest of Dorothy’s nieces who live at the Eggers residence, testified that he asked her to accompany him to the Division of Motor Vehicles and sign the paperwork in her aunt’s name.</p><p>She tried writing Dorothy’s name several times to comply with this requirement, but Eggers eventually signed the ownership certificate in his wife’s name and acquired another in the buyer’s name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfp7y1tNhmnKCflafAbrnUq5ueql2YrrSxjJqlnWWYqsCjrc2dZJqqpJ3Cs3nEoJ6eqqNisKmt0aCcnWWZqHqpsYysq6KknGK2r3nJmqClZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
