Joey was known for her beautiful voice, beautiful smile and beautiful marriage partnership with Rory Feek. Together they shared a life built around a love of faith, family, farming and country music. Their stories, which ranged from growing vegetables to their blossoming as a country music duo, have impacted countless people through television, radio and performances. While grateful for numerous accolades and countless career dreams that came true, Joey found the real meaning and joys of life to be one of love for her GOD, love for her home and family, love for planting and growing and love for sharing with everyone she knew.
