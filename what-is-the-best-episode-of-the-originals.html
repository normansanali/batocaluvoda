I liked it more than the Vampire Diaries personally, but do yourself a favor and stop watching at season 4. It does a good job at wrapping everything up, and you'll be spared the disaster the show became in season five, which was basically just a long backdoor pilot to the show Legacies.<h2>Who is the best original vampire?</h2>Vampires — they may have a taste for human blood, but pop culture loves them just the same. When it comes to Vampire Diaries' spinoff series The Originals, there's one vampire who stands out amongst his kind, and that's Elijah Mikaelson.<h2>Is Elena on The Originals?</h2>Dobrev's Elena was a fan favorite for several years as the show helped launch the CW into the place it is today.

Those who like Vampire Diaries must watch Originals. and yeah Originals has higher IMDb ratings than Vampire Diaries. Originally Answered: Which is better: The Vampire Diaries or The Originals?<h2>Is Legacies or originals better?</h2>“The Originals” did the best with the idea of origin stories as well as different supernatural factions living together. “Legacies,” being the only series still going, has the ability to move away from parody and repetition. However, it also has the greatest possibility of abandoning its origins too much.<h2>Why is The Originals the best?</h2>The Originals gave viewers more modernized characters that were diverse and inclusive of LGBT relationships and people of color. There were multiple characters of color, unlike TVD that really only had Bonnie. It also had multiple characters that were part of the LGBT community, while TVD had none.<h2>Should I watch TVD before The Originals?</h2>You start by watching The Vampire Diaries Season 1 through Season 4 straight through, and then watch just the Season 5 premiere before moving on to the first two episodes of The Originals Season 1.<h2>Is Vampire Diaries better than Twilight?</h2>Although Twilight is a love story, The Vampire Diaries takes the crown when it comes to showcasing passionate romances. The characters in The Vampire Diaries have complex relationships with each other that result in heartbreak, confusion and complicated fallouts. The vampires in Twilight are much tamer.<h2>What should I watch first Vampire Diaries or The Originals?</h2>You can start by watching the first four seasons of The Vampire Diaries before intertwining TVD episodes with The Originals. If you're wondering how best to do this, a pop culture fan has laid it out for you in a well-developed and likely time-consuming list.<h2>Who was in the most episodes of vampire Diaries?</h2>1 Damon Salvatore: 171 Episodes.<h2>Can 13 year olds watch vampire Diaries?</h2>While The Vampire Diaries is supernatural-themed, the show is a certainly edgier than Twilight. Violence, drinking and a general disregard for consequence run riff throughout. It's not ideal viewing for the younger teenage audience.<h2>Can 11 year old watch TVD?</h2>11+ There is some drinking,drugs,blood,violence,sex scenes and more but you can easily look away I suggest this for MATURE 11+ Overall really good! There also isn't much swearing.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZpmeq6RisrG10qibnmWfm3q1tMRmpquhl567orjS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
