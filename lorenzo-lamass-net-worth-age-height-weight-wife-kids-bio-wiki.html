He continuously appeared in 227 episodes of this TV series and bagged huge accolades, acclaim, and several awards.</p><p>Along with this TV series, he appeared in other TV series and films too.

Bounty Tracker, Final Impact, and Snake Eater are some of the most popular films of Lorenzo.</p><p>He appeared in nearly 50 films, but only a few films turned out to be successful. He also appeared in a number of TV series, including Renegade, Leave it to Lamas, California Fever, and Falcon Crest.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-achievements></span>Awards & achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas has several nominations such as Razzie Award, Soap Opera Digest Award, Golden Globe Award, and Golden Rose Award.
