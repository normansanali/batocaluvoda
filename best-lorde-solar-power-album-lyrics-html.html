We finally got a new Lorde album to soak in like sunbeams. <a href=#>Solar Power</a> isn’t the bombastic Melodrama or the angsty Pure Heroine; it’s straight-up vibes — <a href=#>cucumber bongs</a> and all. It’s an album that Lorde sees as “sexy, playful, feral, and free” and “vibrating at the highest level when summer comes around.” Perfect for our last few precious weeks of summer. But with all the talk of Solar Power’s carefree attitude, it wouldn’t be Lorde without a bit of existentialism, snarky fun, and ripped-straight-out-of-the-diary lyrics. So below, we looked at all the cheekiest moments from Solar Power that made us go, Oh!</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckskfwsw5001l3h6iiy6asisq@published>“The Path”</h2><p>“Now if you’re looking for a savior / Well, that’s not me / You need someone to take your pain for you? / Well, that’s not me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckskg4u0c00363h6ie8lq5m8v@published data-word-count=33>Lorde really started with a punch.
