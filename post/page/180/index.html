As a result Ivy Bridge is the first true compute capable GPU from Intel. This marks an interesting step in the evolution of Intel's GPUs, as originally projects such as Larrabee Prime were supposed to help Intel bring together CPU and GPU computing by creating an x86 based GPU. <a href=../../../intel-core-i5-3470-review-hd-2500-graphics-tested.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../post/page/179/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
