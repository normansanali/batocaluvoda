With their unique blend of size, athleticism, and skill, the Antetokounmpo brothers have taken the NBA by storm. In this article, we will delve into the fascinating story of the Antetokounmpo family and explore just how many brothers from this extraordinary clan have made it to the NBA.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Antetokounmpo Family</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Antetokounmpo family hails from Nigeria, but they moved to Greece in the late 1990s in search of a better life. The family consists of Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who are the parents, and five sons: Francis, Thanasis, <a href=#>Giannis</a>, Kostas, and Alex.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Francis Antetokounmpo</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The eldest of the Antetokounmpo brothers, Francis, was the first to make a name for himself in the basketball world. He played for Filathlitikos B.C., a Greek basketball club, but unfortunately, he never made it to the <a href=#>NBA</a>. Although Francis did not reach the same level of stardom as his younger brothers, his passion for the game undoubtedly influenced them.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Thanasis Antetokounmpo</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the second oldest brother, followed in Francis' footsteps and also pursued a career in basketball. He played college basketball at the University of Dayton before declaring for the 2014 NBA Draft. Thanasis was selected by the New York Knicks in the second round, but his NBA journey didn't take off immediately.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Thanasis spent several seasons honing his skills in the NBA G League, playing for the Westchester Knicks. In 2019, he finally received his chance in the NBA when he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks, joining his younger brother Giannis. Thanasis has since become a valuable role player for the Bucks, known for his energy, defense, and high-flying dunks.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Giannis Antetokounmpo, often referred to as "<a href=#>The Greek Freak</a>," is the most famous and accomplished of the Antetokounmpo brothers. Born in Athens, Greece, Giannis quickly rose to prominence due to his incredible physical gifts and versatility on the court.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>After playing professionally for Filathlitikos B.C., Giannis entered the 2013 NBA Draft and was selected 15th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Since then, he has become an NBA superstar, earning multiple All-Star selections, MVP awards, and leading the Bucks to their first NBA championship in 2021.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Giannis' unique playing style, which combines his size, speed, and ball-handling skills, has made him one of the most dominant players in the league. He is known for his ability to play multiple positions, guard all five positions, and excel in both offense and defense.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Kostas and Alex Antetokounmpo</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The youngest of the Antetokounmpo brothers, Kostas and Alex, are still making their way through the ranks of professional basketball. Kostas Antetokounmpo played college basketball at the University of Dayton, following in the footsteps of his older brother Thanasis. He declared for the 2018 NBA Draft and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kostas has primarily played in the NBA G League, with short stints in the NBA for the Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers. While he has yet to establish himself in the NBA, Kostas has shown flashes of potential and continues to work on his game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Alex Antetokounmpo, the youngest of the brothers, is currently playing college basketball at the University of Wisconsin. He is considered a promising prospect and has the potential to follow in the footsteps of his older brothers and make it to the NBA.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Antetokounmpo family has produced a remarkable basketball legacy. While only three of the five brothers have played in the NBA so far, their impact has been significant. <a href=#>Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> has become one of the league's brightest stars, while Thanasis and Kostas have also made their mark in the NBA. As for Alex, the youngest brother, the future looks promising. With their dedication, talent, and love for the game, it wouldn't be surprising to see more Antetokounmpo brothers dominating the NBA in the years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfnby4ecyapbJlkaPBpsDOpKaupp2lvG6u0airoZ2iqHqivsRmoKdlpJ2ybrrBmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
