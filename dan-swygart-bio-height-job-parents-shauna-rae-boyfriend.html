However, the latter has been criticized vehemently for the prospective relationship. Who is he? Who are his parents? What job does he have?</p><p>Read all about it below as you scroll down this article.</p><h3><strong>Meet Dan Swygart, Shauna Rae Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Fans and followers of TLC’s I Am Shauna Rae may have always wondered how people would react once a 23-year-old woman who looks like she is 8, finds a man. Shauna Rae has started dating Dan Swygart. The pair recently went public with their relationship which Rae posting a preview clip of their upcoming episode in season 2 of the show where Dan will be forging a relationship with Shauna.</p><p>Dan recently posted many pictures of Shauna on Instagram before adamantly defending their relationship in a video. Shauna has struggled with dating for a long time; the petite personality recently told The Post that she is undervalued and excluded due to her appearance.</p><p>“If you look at me, you see an 8-year-old,” she told New York Post. “But I think if you take the time to look at the details in my face, in my hands, the maturity in my body — and I think if you take the time to actually talk to me — you really understand that I’m a 23-year-old.”</p><p>Dan said in his clip that after watching Rae’s first season of television, he sent her flowers. They soon met in person and went on a number of dates.</p><p>“It’s very important to remember that Shauna is an incredible 23-year-old woman who has a disability,” he explained. “So as you are building a connection with her, it’s important to acknowledge her disability and look past that and build it with who she is as an individual.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But how dare you take away her right, her human right, to have a connection, a friendship, a relationship with someone else? Who are you to say that she can’t have that?” he added.</p><p>However, the budding relationship has received some scorching public reactions. Some have claimed that he is “sick” for dating someone who looked like an 8-year-old. Others have labeled him “creepy” for connecting with her romantically.</p><p>“I haven’t actually really thought about if Dan and I were in a relationship and how that would look,” Shauna says on the show. “I assume that we would probably try long-distance, but I’ve been in a long-distance relationship. It’s not my cup of tea.”</p><p>Dan stated that the way people were treating the reality star and their friendship had him “Absolutely disgusted.” “I cannot believe some people who deny her the right to have a friendship or connection with someone else,” he said. “She is a human being, she is a cancer survivor, she’s got disability, she had dwarfism. Who are you to take away her right to have a friendship and connection with someone? How dare you? How dare you?”</p><p>“I did the show knowing I was going to get some hate but it’s very important to remember that Shauna is an incredible 23-year-old woman who has a disability,” Dan continued in the post. “So as you’re building a connection with her, it’s important to acknowledge her disability and look past that and build it with who she is as an individual.”</p><p>Dan continued in the video, “As soon as you say that she can’t have a real-world connection with someone else, you dehumanize her. She is a human being. She deserves to have relationships and connections with whoever she wants.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Me and Shauna are still just good friends getting to know each other. But I think it’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>absolutely disgusting</a> the attitude of some people,” Dan shared in the video. “She’s been through so much in life. She survived cancer as a child, she’s always felt different and been treated differently by society.”</p><p>Before Shauna, he had one relationship that was publicly shared. Her name was Camille Biagini. They were together in July 2019 but haven’t shared much since.</p><h3><strong>Dan Swygart Age</strong></h3><p>As of January 2023, Dan Swygart is 26 years old.

They are just friends. There is no relationship.” She reiterated: “They are friends.”</p><p>Steven also supported Dan saying, “He has appeared in their show and that’s the extent of it.
