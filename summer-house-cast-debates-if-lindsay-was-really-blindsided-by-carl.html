She’s not lying or making it up to make her seem better. I think she has a version of how things go down and she fully believes it.”</p><p>Because Lindsay believes she wasn’t the issue, Amanda thinks her costar couldn’t comprehend how Carl, 39, “could call it off when she’s done nothing wrong because that’s how she truly, actually believes.”</p><p>During the season 8 finale, which premiered Thursday, May 30, viewers finally watched Carl <a href=#>break up with Lindsay</a> less than three months before their scheduled wedding day. Before the tense discussion, Carl met with close friend <strong>Kyle Cooke</strong> to share his concerns about the relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Summer-House-Cast-Debates-If-Lindsay-Hubbard-Was-Really-Blindsided-by-Carl-Radke-Split.jpg><p>From Gabby’s perspective, she wishes Carl had bigger conversations with Lindsay instead of his friends. “If he was having this severe of a reaction, you make the time before I get cameras up to be like, ‘I’m going to blow up her life and mine,’” she said. “If he had issues, there was ample time over the entire summer.”</p><p>Lindsay added, “Carl knew what he was telling Kyle about. Eight years of f–king friendship and you don’t have enough respect for me to tell me first that you are having second thoughts.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the couple’s breakup will be dissected in the two-part <a href=#><i>Summer House</i> reunion</a> beginning June 6, Carl has his doubts that Lindsay was truly shocked by the split.</p><p>“I don’t want to speculate,” he said on the <i>Summer House: After</i> Show. “I think you guys can watch the tapes to learn for yourself.”</p><p><i>Summer House</i> airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. with new episodes streaming next day on Peacock. New episodes of the Summer House: After Show drop every Friday on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqupZ2av260zq6qnmWTlsC1ecOemZqslah6qrKMpaCnnKOWxm7DwKxkq52Robm6ecGloKeco56xprCMm7Bmm5GnuXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
