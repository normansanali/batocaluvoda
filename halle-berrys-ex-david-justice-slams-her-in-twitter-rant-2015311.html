An insider tells <strong>Us Weekly</strong>, however, that neither the actress nor her reps have addressed the issue at all, or commented on his tweets. He appears to have been referring to a post from TMZ, which cited a source saying that Berry never pointed the finger at him to begin with.&nbsp;</p><p>"She never said he beat her and then cleared his name, so he didn't read the TMZ post correctly," the source says. "She has continued to have no comment."</p><p>—</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Justice has since deleted most of his tweets. Speaking with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> about the rant, he said, "Having three kids, [ages] 15, 13 and 11, the careless reporting of me being the one who caused her hearing loss is unacceptable," he said. "That was the only purpose of my tweets, really. I just felt that if I didn't say anything about this particular thing, my kids' friends might read it and assume that it was true. I'm in the community coaching baseball, football, and basketball, and I can't have that."</p><p>He further clarified that he meant no disrespect. "I don't have anything else to say about Halle nor was I trying to bash her," Justice told ET. "Nor will I speak on all of the other rumors of our relationship."</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Halle Berry</strong>'s ex-husband <strong>David Justice</strong> has some strong feelings about her split from <strong>Olivier Martinez</strong>. The former baseball pro, 49, slammed the actress in a Twitter rant on Monday, Nov. 2, claiming she tried to destroy his character after their divorce in 1997, and warning Martinez that the same thing could happen to him.</p><p>Justice, who wed the Oscar winner in 1992, started out by addressing reports that he'd abused Berry, also 49, during their marriage. After they separated in 1996, she took out a restraining order against him; he maintained at the time that he posed "absolutely no threat."</p><p>In the years since, Berry has opened up about her experience with an abusive ex-boyfriend, whom she has never named. In his Twitter rant on Monday, Justice insisted he's not the ex in question.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Reading the latest Halle Berry Reports,it wasn't me who hit Halle causing the ear damage.Halle has never said that I hit her.</p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It was a former Hollywood boyfriend (WS) that she told me ! <a href=#>#getyourfactsright</a></p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>When she first reported that she had been in abusive relationships,she wouldn't name the "famous" former boyfriend (WS)..</p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>She was mad at me leaving the relationship so she and her Hollywood Team just tried to destroy my character.It had to be my fault,right?</p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p>He went on to mention some of the actress' other exes, including her ex-husband <strong>Eric Benet</strong>, her ex-boyfriend <strong>Gabriel Aubry</strong> (with whom she shares daughter <strong>Nahla</strong>, 7), and Martinez, dad to Berry's son <strong>Maceo</strong>, 2.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Yup..Me,Eric,Gabriel and Olivier were all her "Knight in Shining Armor",until it ends..Then we all become the worst guys in history.</p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Only the guys in the relationship with Halle know the real deal..there will be another,of course.He'll be called "The Best" until it ends.</p><p>— david justice (@23davidjustice) <a href=#>November 3, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Just wait,Olivier..It's coming!
