WWE Hall of Famer Diamond Dallas Page shared the news of Houge‚Äôs passing in a <a href=#>heartfelt message on Facebook</a>.</p><p>In DDP‚Äôs touching tribute, he described Harold Houge as one of his closest brothers, a warrior, and one of the kindest individuals he had ever known. Their 30-year relationship was filled with laughter and brotherhood, with both families being interconnected. DDP reminisced about their joint efforts to help less fortunate families during Christmas, spreading cheer to those in need.</p><p>Included in the post were cherished memories, including a photo of DDP, Ice Train, and DDP‚Äôs mother Sylvia at Payge‚Äôs and DDP‚Äôs wedding. DDP expressed his intention to create a tribute video in the coming week to honor his friend properly.</p><p>It was so Sad to hear, that one of my closest brothers is gone. Harold Houge aka H aka Ice Train aka Smooth was a warrior and one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever known. Our 30 year relationship was filled with laughter & brotherhood. We were always there for each other. Our families are one family. One of my fondest memories was the Christmas the two of us headed into the inner city to help many of the less fortunate families have a better Christmas. As you can see we got on our favorite Christmas outfits and headed out to spread some cheer. I‚Äôve also included one my favorite pictures of H & my mom Sylvia at Payge‚Äôs & my wedding. I will put up a tribute video up later next week. I just don‚Äôt have the strength to do it yet.<br><br>RIP my brother!<br><br>You will be missed but never forgotten!<br><br>Much Love & Respectüôè&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Payge McMahon</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marc Mero</a><br>DDP</p><p>DDP bid farewell to his brother, saying that Harold Houge would be missed but never forgotten. <a href=#>Ringside News </a>joins in sending con</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> joins in sending condolences to the family, friends, and fans of Harold Houge during this difficult time.</p><p>Feel free to leave your condolences or any stories you may have in the comments as a tribute to his legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX91e49qZmtrX5u8s7nEq2Swm6dixLOx0q2jnqpdnrCmedOrmKKmXaiupbjYZqeaq6OawG6t1pqwZpmkYq6osYxubWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
