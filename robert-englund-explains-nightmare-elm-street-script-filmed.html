I think that would be really interesting, to discover the truth of the Nightmare on Elm Street to the eyes, and then she would fulfill the balance of the ingredients and the recipe and the menu of Nightmare on Elm Street, which is you need a strong woman, always, to take you through. It always has to be through the eyes of a strong woman, because even if they’re skeptical and wise and cynical, they still need to lose some of their innocence about the darkness and the evil that lurks in the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-10.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-11.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-12.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Freddy-Krueger-in-The-Goldbergs-13.jpg><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>He went on to explain the issue that would now prevent the screenplay being filmed, saying:</p><p>“The problem with that script is I wrote it a long time ago and her detective skills are now antiquated. The things that I had her do that I thought were novel and new and cool are antiquated, because I wrote this back in the ‘90s, so now I wouldn’t be able to update because it’s not as advanced as the stuff she would use.”</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Despite acknowledging the redundancy of the methods featured, Englund is still convinced that the core idea has merit.</p><p>“It would be interesting for someone to try to solve what happened, looking back, and you could even have her older now. You could have her be a graduate student, 28 years old, and just wondering what happened to her little sister all those years ago. It would be fun to do.”</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=884 data-injectable=false>The concept certainly has potential, as since we as an audience are accepting of the supernatural nature of Freddy, having someone investigate it from a skeptical and outside perspective could be an intriguing way of developing the story, not to mention the emotional connection that slasher films often lack. And with Wes Craven’s estate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opening the doors to pitches for new movies</a> in the <strong>Nightmare on Elm Street </strong>franchise, there’s still the possibility for the idea to at least partially be realized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9GomZ6qpGKyr7PLrqWdZZWtva2tyKeqZqaZnLW1ucCrnGadnKJ6tMDRnpytZaOYv6q802adoqSdmrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
