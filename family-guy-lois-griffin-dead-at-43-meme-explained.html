Creator Seth MacFarlane came up with first iteration of the show — a slapstick comedy about a man and his talking dog — during his time at the Rhode Island School of Design and over time, the idea morphed into the adult cartoon we watch today. The comedy, inspired by sitcoms like The Simpsons, wasn’t an instant hit and was actually cancelled after its third season. Due to high DVD sales and a positive reaction to reruns airing on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim, the show was revived in 2005 and has been going strong ever since.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>For anyone unfamiliar with Family Guy, the animated series follows the daily lives of a dysfunctional family and their talking dog. Macfarlane stars as the family patriarch Peter Griffin, Alex Bornstein voices his wife Lois, Mila Kunis is their daughter Meg, Seth Green plays their older son Chris. Youngest son Stewie and the Griffin’s anthropomorphic dog Brian are also voiced by MacFarlane. As long as the show has been airing, the Griffin family has been getting into absurd situations, and naturally, Family Guy has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spawned many a meme</a> in its 23 years.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>The latest meme from Family Guy has recently begun circulating but its more confusing than one might expect. In the past couple days, news of Lois’ death has begun trending on social media and this has fans and casual viewers wondering if they missed an important Family Guy plotline. Where did this meme come from? Is Lois truly dead? We’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-family-guy-lois-griffin-dead-at-43-trending data-injectable=false>Why is ‘Family Guy Lois Griffin Dead at 43’ trending?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lois Griffin DEAD AT 43 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uhmTyeKrTl</a></p>— Patty LaCerva 💌𓆦 (@minasdemon) <a href=#>December 25, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Like most memes, Twitter is to blame for the ‘Lois is dead’ meme. On Christmas Day, Twitter user @minasdemon posted the original “Lois Griffin DEAT AT 43” meme with a short clip of a woman (not Lois) screaming. The tweet quickly blew up and as of writing, has over 21 million views.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Many responded to the sad news with memes of their own.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9hcq9kzFbJ</a></p>— Momma Heartbreak (@pushpins_) <a href=#>December 26, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Some Twitter users declared the news too serious to joke about.

Recently, users have been telling their parents a favorite celebrity has died and recording their reactions using the hashtag <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#celebritydeadprank</a> which already has over 70 million views and climbing.</p><h2 id=h-is-lois-griffin-dead data-injectable=false>Is Lois Griffin dead?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, this happened… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3SXdTeML8s</a></p>— Patty LaCerva 💌𓆦 (@minasdemon) <a href=#>December 27, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Like many cartoon characters, Lois has been grievously injured in the past.

We’re happy to report that Borstein is super active on social media and appears to be fine. She recently posted a video on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> just a few days ago and looked to be in good health. We’ll keep you update if she acknowledges the meme.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ynrcyio7Jll6rGbrjOoqpmn6Kes6e1zWabnpmUYq61eZNsZKadnZp6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
