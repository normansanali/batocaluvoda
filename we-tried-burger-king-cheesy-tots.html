Of course, if you'd rather not partake in either of those, or you just need a snack, like, now, you can try <a href=#>Burger King</a>'s Cheesy Tots. Because <a href=#>we tried</a> the tots to see if they could ever replace fries or (dare we say) onion rings. And, of course, we have some thoughts.</p><p>The Cheesy Tots from Burger King aren't just deep-fried tater tots slathered in melty cheese. Instead, the tots have all of the cheesiness on the inside, while the outside is golden and crispy. Sure, you may get a few tots that are a little misshapen or messy, but that's a risk we all take when it comes to fast food.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Distractify</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We tried Burger King Cheesy Tots.</h2><p>Like we said before, sometimes it's the luck of the draw with fast food presentation. But in our case, the Cheesy Tots looked just like the photos. All four were round, golden, and crispy. The only drawback was the cheesiness. We didn't expect it to come oozing out, but the more the merrier, and these needed just a tad more.</p><p>One of the best parts about them, though, is that you can eat them on the go like Burger King's fries or onion rings. They come in orders of four or eight for $1.49<strong> </strong>and $2.49, respectively, and they're easy to pop in your mouth wherever and whenever. And they do taste a bit like the traditional cheesy potatoes you might have at a holiday party.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Distractify</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long are Burger King's Cheesy Tots here?</h2><p>This isn't the first time Burger King rolled out the Cheesy Tots. They were originally a temporary part of the fast food chain's menu in 2021. And now, two years later, there was enough demand for the side dish to bring them back. But what everyone really wants to know is how long Burger King's Cheesy Tots are here.</p><p>According to ads for the Cheesy Tots and even the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>, the Burger King snack is here "for a limited time only." That means you only have so much time to get 'em while they're hot â€” literally. There is the chance that Burger King will bring back the Cheesy Tots at some point in the future, or that they could become a permanent menu item.</p><p>But for now, there is an end in sight. Buy Burger King Cheesy Tots at participating Burger King locations nationwide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLJuwNGinJ1lkqq%2FqLHRZqKippdisKmxxKywZqyfqcA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
