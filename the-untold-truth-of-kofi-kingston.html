The thing is, the more ridiculous their antics got, the more the crowd embraced them. That happens pretty often in pro wrestling; characters like <a href=#>the Rock</a>, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and, more recently, Kevin Owens, all became beloved superstars by just being too entertaining as bad guys.

For a while, the official WWE store was selling unicorn-horn headbands. At one point, they even made their entrance at WrestleMania by popping out of a ten-foot tall box of Booty-Os cereal while dressed as DragonBall Z characters, which is like three different layers of goofiness going on at the same time.</p><p>But they weren't just a comedy act. Those years also saw some fantastic wrestling from the three performers, including a lengthy span as the SmackDown Tag Team Champions — their third of four championship reigns was, at the time, the longest since the title's inception — and a series of matches with the Usos that culminated at Hell in a Cell 2016.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lW1tcmxfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2gvKe1jKSgp5%2Bjqbyvew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
