Houser Street, starting Saturday, March 16. The Compost Facility is open daily from 12-5 p.m. in March and April. Extended hours of 12-5 p.m. Sunday through Friday and from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on Saturdays starting May 1. Click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a> for the fee schedule for nonresident and commercial users.</p><p>Brush and branches less than 10 inches in diameter and 10 feet in length can also be dropped off at the facility. Larger tree sections and logs can also be taken there, but tree stumps or roots are not accepted. Residents should ensure loaded items are securely fastened, as loose trees, branches and compost can cause traffic hazards and vehicle damage.</p><p>The city still offers year-round curbside yard waste collection on normal trash collection days. Grass clippings, leaves and garden waste will be picked up by the Solid Waste Division if the items are in a yard waste bag with a City of Muscatine sticker placed on the bag. Bags no longer have to be special bags with the city name and logo; they now offer stickers that can be attached to any compostable yard waste bag. Stickers are $1.50 each and are available at the Muscatine Transfer Station, Muscatine City Hall, Muscatine Public Works, Fareway, HyVee and HyVee Mainstreet. Stickers are only necessary for bags that would be set out curbside for the City to collect. The top of the bag should be folded up, using the sticker to help keep the top closed. The sticker must be visible to City staff as they collect waste. Stickers aren’t necessary for those who take the compostable paper bags with yard waste to the Compost Facility. There will be a fee for nonresidents to leave yard waste at the Compost Facility.</p><p>Guidelines for yard waste compostable bags for curbside collection are:</p><ul><li>Bags must contain yard waste only. No trash, recycling, building materials or animal waste.</li><li>Grass clippings, leaves and garden waste must be placed in 20- or 30-gallon paper compostable bags and closed with a City of Muscatine yard waste sticker.</li><li>Bags must not be overfilled (50 pound maximum) and kept dry.</li><li>Bags containing grass clippings, leaves and garden waste will be picked up at the curb on the residents’ regular refuse collection day.</li><li>Stickers are for City of Muscatine residential yard waste collection only.</li><li>Bags must be placed on the curb after 4 p.m. the day before but before 5 a.m. the day of collection.</li><li>Tree limbs and other trimmings from trees and shrubs will be collected curbside on the residents’ refuse collection day and must be bundled together with string or cord in four-foot lengths.</li></ul><p>Tree limbs and other trimmings from trees and shrubs will be collected curbside on the residents refuse collection day must be fastened together with string or cord in four-foot bundles.</p><p>Residents of Muscatine and Fruitland will not be charged a fee for the use of the Compost Facility if they subscribe to City of Muscatine refuse collection.

An attendant will be onsite at the Compost Facility to verify residency and take payment from nonresidents and commercial users. The fee can be paid by cash or check only, with no bills larger than $20, during Compost Site operating hours.</p><p>Gardeners who want to pick up a load of compost can get help with loading on weekdays from 12-3:30 p.m., subject to staff availability.
