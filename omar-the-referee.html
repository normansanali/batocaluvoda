People know him as Omar the Referee, his internet name, which got popular after one of his TIkTok videos went viral.</p><p>We are talking about a small clip where Omar could be seen training young school kids. People made this video a meme material and made their version which made Omar famous worldwide.</p><p>In August 2023, news came that Omar, The Referee, committed suicide due to cyberbullying. Netizens quickly believed the word and expressed their condolences to the grieved family.</p><p>After some days, someone claimed that Wilson was not dead, and his death rumors were fake. Soon debate among netizens regarding Omar started, which gave birth to many rumors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Omar-the-Referee.webp><h2><strong>Omar the Referee’s Death Rumors&nbsp;<br></strong></h2><p>People on the internet debate this topic, and everybody has their version of the story regarding the viral referee. Some trusted platforms claim that BBC first revealed Omar’s death.</p><p>Upon checking BBC’s news website, we did not find any article about the death of a Baltimore resident. Soon we saw a screenshot of a tweet from BBC claiming the 47-year-old referee died.</p><p>Looking at the screenshot, it appears that somebody edited the photo to make the news of Wilson’s death accurate; also, we did not find any such tweet on BBC’s Twitter handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Omar-the-Referee-is-not-dead.webp><h2><strong>Omar the Referee Declared Alive</strong></h2><p>On the one hand, we have untrustworthy sources of information that claim that Omar is dead; on the other hand, we have a TikTok handle claiming the referee is alive.</p><p>The TikTok handle with username ‘@omarwilson460’ appears to be the authentic account of Omar. According to this account, the beloved basketball coach is alive and living a sound life in his hometown Baltimore. Our take is that he is alive, and people spread fake rumors about his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fake-BBC-Tweet-Screenshot-of-Omar-the-Referee.webp><h2><strong>Omar the Referee Parents and Early Life</strong></h2><p>In 1976, Omar Wilson, aka Omar The Referee (age 47), was born in an African-American family in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. He developed his love for Basketball due to his father, with whom he used to watch sportspersons like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar play.</p><p>Wilson’s love for the game motivated him to pursue it as a career; he could be part of leagues like the NBA, but he became a coach and now works as a basketball referee cum coach at a local school.</p><p>As we know, Omar, the ref, is a popular internet personality with a huge fanbase because of his videos where he appears to train young school kids.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Omar the Referee" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Is-Omar-the-Referee-dead.webp alt="Is Omar the Referee dead" width=500 height=444 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As per sources, Wilson shot to popularity after he uploaded a video on TikTok where he claimed to be the best Basketball coach in Baltimore, Maryland, which for some reason, people found so funny that they began editing the video to make memes.</p><p>His second video that got viral was the one in which a child passes him the ball, and he grabs it in a manner that some quote as ‘stylish’ gameplay.
