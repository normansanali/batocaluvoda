"For us Indians, he's like Hemingway," <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>she told Jess Cagle</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/eb86211884de-gettyimages-74982033.jpg><p id=eCZRXTPRl5L data-wc=66>"Imagine a young woman in her twenties, who loves books and who had published her little cookbook and in comes this guy," Padma recalled. "I mean, he was the best thing that ever happened to me by a mile. The fact that somebody of that stature and calibre was even interested remotely enough in me to want to take me to lunch was kind of unbelievable."</p><p id=e9QFsFvY-4 data-wc=8><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman's relationship timeline</a></p><p id=eGvgCZDO3D data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS star Jennifer Esposito's ex-husband is a major Hollywood A-lister</a></p><p id=e-TJPW2BLb data-wc=61>Following their first date in Central Park, and Salman's finalized divorce from his third wife, the couple moved in together in 2000. "For me, it was wonderful because I finally had somebody who understood me because he too was Indian and he was also living in the West and he was very nimble in navigating those two worlds," Padma told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/4553981b1701-gettyimages-89767073.jpg><p id=esX5zDfD8lS data-wc=24>The couple eventually married in 2004. Both the wedding ceremony and the afterparty took place on the 14th floor of a lavish Manhattan studio.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3QDIQYI5or data-wc=50>Following their nuptials, however, Padma and Salman faced several challenges in their relationship. The TV personality explained that as she progressed in her career and became more in-demand, Salman became resentful. "I just wanted to also do something else on my own," she said. "I just wanted my own identity."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/83db67d06601-gettyimages-71993776.jpg><p id=emrqbI2NLZY data-wc=51>In her 2022 memoir , Padma also cited her experience of Endometriosis (which was then undiagnosed) as a key factor in their 2007 divorce. A condition that caused her chronic pain and often left her bedridden, it also led to a lack of intimacy between them.&nbsp;</p><p id=ef651n_cA7i data-wc=43>​​"Endometriosis was definitely a major reason that my marriage failed and I don't think either of us understood it at the time," she said. "I think that Salman took it personally and I think that he felt rejected, and I can understand that."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/930b65a7bd3e-gettyimages-604706948.jpg><p id=eljfXOgUAsc data-wc=35>While the couple divorced in 2007, Padma and Salman have remained friends. Reflecting on their "wonderful years" together and how she consciously tried to be "even-handed" when writing about them in her memoir, Padma added:</p><p id=eHpXB7CDwmL data-wc=55>"I do still love him. In many ways, I consider him still part of my family. I think if you really fall in love with someone, even if you fall out of love with them, you still must have some little portion, some little imprint, on your heart that can never be extinguished or erased."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Celebrity couples with the biggest age gaps</figure><p id=eis9sdGib9 data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYSYcmpyZ6SWwLWxjK2fnmWelsGqu81mp5qcnZZ6ra3KrJ%2BmoV2brq671KxknrBdncK0rsCnm2arkaG6orqMq6ysoJSesnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
