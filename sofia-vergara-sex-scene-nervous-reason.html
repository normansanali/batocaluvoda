After all, the role was not only her first dramatic role in Hollywood but it’s based on a real-life drug lord who committed some nasty crimes in her day. But, all that aside, it seems another part of filming was especially intimidating for Vergara.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When asked if there was&nbsp;ever a moment she felt out of her depth during filming at a Netflix FYSEE event this week, Vergara answered without any hesitation. “The <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-scene_1 data-tag=sex-scene>sex scene</a>,” she answered, per <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Sun</a>. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sofia-vergara-joe-manganiello.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara, Joe Manganiello" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Sofía Vergara's Outing on the Anniversary of Her Split From Joe Manganiello Proves She Has Moved On</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t think I’ve ever done like a sex scene,” Vergara reflected, adding that she’d never had to do any steamy scenes with Ed O’Neil in Modern Family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Why was she nervous, you may ask? “I’m 50!” she said. “I mean, when I was 30, I wouldn’t have worried. I think I was worried that I was going to look horrific.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was like, ‘Where are they shooting me? The cellulite? From the side,” she remembered. “Uh, I’m vain I guess. That one kept me awake I think.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Luckily, however, the process was much less scary than she had expected. “It came out good,” she said, sounding relieved. “It’s really dark and [Andrés Baiz], the director, is very artistic and he made me feel super comfortable and he’s like, ‘We’re never going to stay like a long time on you [the camera].'” Looks like that’s all the motivation she needed to get out of her own head. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sofia-vergara-joe-manganiello.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara, Joe Manganiello" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Sofía Vergara's Outing on the Anniversary of Her Split From Joe Manganiello Proves She Has Moved On</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sofia-vergara-joe-manganiello.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Unfortunately, the sex scene was just one of the many things keeping Vergara up at night during filming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’ve only done&nbsp;Modern Family, really, so I didn’t know what I was walking into,” Vergara told<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> fellow A-list actresses</a> in a recent roundtable interview for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “And when I arrived, I realized this is different, and it’s hard when you have to cry and kill and choke and snort cocaine and drink alcohol. And I’d never in my life touched a cigarette. Never. I had to learn and to learn at 50 years old to smoke and you’re going to be in every single scene smoking.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The first three weeks, I’d go home and I didn’t know what was wrong with me,” she admitted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I couldn’t fall asleep. I decided to take Xanax because I had to wake up the next day to go again,” she detailed. “It was either I start sleeping or I’m going to die.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She even confessed to her acting coach Nancy Banks that she wasn’t sure she was cut out for it. “I was like, ‘Nancy, I don’t know if I’m going to survive this,'” Vergara said. “She’s like, ‘You’re an actor now.'” Kudos to her for facing her fears!</p><p><strong>Before you go, check out <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see which movies had the steamiest <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-scenes_1 data-tag=sex-scenes>sex scenes</a> with an older woman and younger man:</strong><br><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async width=693 height=390 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sex-scenes-older-women-younger-men.png alt="Emma Thompson, Jennifer Lopez, Reese Witherspoon" sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoa2BohHR%2FkmiqqJ6Zlnq3sdGgmKuZXaiyuXnSnJynnV2jsrPCzq6qZqqVlsCwuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
