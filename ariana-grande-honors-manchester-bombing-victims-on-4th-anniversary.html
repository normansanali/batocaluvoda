Please know that I am thinking of you today,” the Grammy winner, 27, wrote on Saturday, May 22, via her <a href=#>Instagram Story</a>.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ariana-Grande-Honors-Manchester-Bombing-Victims-Four-Years-Later-Inline.jpg alt="Ariana Grande Honors Manchester Bombing Victims 4 Years Later: 'This Anniversary Will Never Be an Easy One'" width=1000 height=1000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>On May 22, 2017, Grande played a concert at Manchester Arena as a stop on her Dangerous Woman tour. After the show, <a href=#>an explosive device detonated</a> in the foyer area as 14,200 attendees were leaving the venue. Over 500 people were injured and 22 victims died. Police deemed the incident both a terrorist attack and a suicide bombing.</p><p>“Manchester, my heart is with you today and always,” Grande added, above a list of victims’ names: John Atkinson, Courtney Boyle, Philip Tron, Kelly Brewster, Georgina Callander, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Liam Curry, Chloe Rutherford, Wendy Fawell, Martyn Hett, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones, Michelle Kiss, Angelika Klis, Marcin Klis, Morrell Leczkowski, Eilidh MacLeod, Elaine McIver, Saffie Rose Rouses and Jane Tweddle.</p><p>The <a href=#>“Thank U, Next” singer</a> has been vocal about suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress after the incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ariana-Grande-Honors-Manchester-Bombing-Victims-Four-Years-Later-Inline.jpg><p>“We see this s–t on the news, <a href=#>it affects you but not the same way</a>. You feel bad, you tweet it, you post a picture, you send your condolences, you say something and then you move on. But Christmas comes and you’re thinking about it,” Grande said, choking up, during a 2018 Beats 1 Radio interview. “People are permanently affected by this s–t. Perspective, it changes everything. It changes your life quite a bit. You really want to be present, and follow happy impulses, and figure that out later. You want to just stay in the moment. You try not to give in to fear because obviously, that’s the whole point of being here.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Grande headlined the “One Love Manchester” benefit in 2017, which also featured <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a>, <strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Coldplay</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>Pharrell Williams</strong></a>, the <strong><a href=#>Black Eyed Peas</a></strong> and the late <a href=#>Mac Miller</a>, and raised <a href=#>£7.3 million</a> ($10.33 million) for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund.</p><p>She returned to Manchester in 2019 to perform at a LGBTQ Pride event and made it clear <a href=#>how grateful she was</a> to be back in the British city.</p><p>“I’m so happy to be with you, so thank you for having me,” Grande told the crowd at the time. “Sorry, I’m so nervous. I had so much more to say but I’m really very overwhelmed. So thank you. … Obviously, Manchester holds a very special place in my heart.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5xquYp5yVYrWwus6rqmalkaOwqbHSrZyrZZKkuqO1zaBkr6GTqbauv4yopWZspJ16orrNoq2eqqOWv7p7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
