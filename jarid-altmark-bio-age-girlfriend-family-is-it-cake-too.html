Since then, he’s won various awards and made several appearances in Food Network competitions.

Viewers and even the judges couldn’t differentiate a cake bucket hat, conch shell, or even a sneaker from the real one. Obviously, the show was a hit. That’s why it’s back for its second installment with a brand new set of talented chefs including our star Jarid Altmark.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ready to make you question your reality like never before, this fresh batch of bakers who specialize in hyperrealistic bakes will be tasked once again to make the most unlikely objects out of the cake. Think baseball gloves, weekender bags, toilets, and even the Mona Lisa herself — with the hopes of deceiving a slew of seasoned chefs and celebrity guests, and also bagging a share of a $120,000 prize pot.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Jarid, he was happier about being able to share his grandmother with the world, 11 years after her death. Presenting the viewers and the judges with a pot that reminded him of her, he said, “Her infectious laugh, sneezes in nines. Resilient cast iron with the graciousness of a grandma as bold as Mrs.Dash seasoning. I remember it in her office, bottom left cabinet next to the stove, almost as vividly as the obnoxious floral breath that’s weaved into every memory like the yarn of my afghan.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Jarid confessed that he never loved his grandmother as he does now.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Jarid for the second season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake Too?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were his co-stars Corterrius Allen, Danya Smith, Elizabeth Rowe, Justin Salinas, Kayla Giddings, Liz Marek, Miko Kaw Hok Uy, Pete Tidwell, and Spirit Wallace.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> In 2018, Jarid applied and competed in Halloween Wars (Season 9) as the youngest competitor to ever compete?&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Jarid Altmark Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jarid Altmark is a multi-award-winning cake artist who has been making cakes since he was 12 years old.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Falling in love with the artistry behind craft-watching shows like Ace of Cakes, Food Network Challenge, and Cake Boss, Jarid competed in his first cake competition at the age of 14 and also founded </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jarid’s Awesome Cakes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> with the help of his parents.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since then, he’s won several awards in competitions at the student and professional levels and has been featured in several collaborations and magazines such as American Cake Decorating Magazine, Cake Masters Magazine, UCF Today, Entertainment Weekly, and WESH2 News.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Today, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jarid’s Awesome Cakes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> offers classes for aspiring bakers and several buyable tutorials/recipes.
