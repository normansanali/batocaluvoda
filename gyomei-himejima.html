Without his eyesight, Gyomei Himejima commands the respect of both Demon Slayers and demons while being physically stronger than his colleague Demon Slayer Hashira, wielding one of the most amazing Nichirin blades in historical times. Gyomei has a significant supporting role in the manga, where demonstrations of his strength are evident, even though he hasn’t had much screen time in Demon Slayer season 2 or its predecessors.</p><p>The nine Demon Slayer Hashira are second only to the Corps leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki, in holding one of the highest ranks in the Demon Slayer Corps. Each Hashira, including Gyomei Himejima, is a pro at a particular Breathing Style, such as Love, Stone, or Mist. Each Hashira is given a region to watch over, where they keep an eye out for demons and try to improve their skills even more. Some Hashira even hire apprentices to take their place. Former Hashira Sakonji Urokodaki, the former Water Hashira, and Jigoro Kuwajima, the former Thunder Hashira, both trained Tanjiro Kamado and Zenitsu Agatsuma.</p><p>Gyomei Himejima was born blind and raised nine orphan children in a shrine before becoming a Demon Slayer Hashira. Gyomei Himejima beat the invading demon with his bare fists till dawn after the demon had killed all but one of the kids. He was wrongfully imprisoned for the kidnapping, but Ubuyashiki prevented him from being put to death. After only two months in the Demon Slayer Corps, he would join as a Demon Slayer and be elevated to the position of Stone Pillar. Even among his Hashira teammates in Demon Slayer, Himejima stands head and shoulders above them based only on his past.</p><h3>Why Gyomei Himejima Is The Strongest Hashira In Demon Slayer<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Demon-Slayer-Gyomei-Himejima-1-2.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>Gyomei Himejima is Demon Slayer’s most potent Hashira because of his obvious power in battle. Gyomei was able to hold off a demon till dawn even without a blade by using only her pure physical power. His Nichirin Blade, which is regarded as one of the best-made in his torical times, is special since he is the only Demon Slayer Hashira whose blade assumes the shape of an axe. Gyomei Himejima used his superhum an hearing to adapt and follow the sound of the chain during fight to track his weapon and fill in for his lack of vision during his training. His axe is attached to a spiky flail by a lengthy chain. Gyomei is also exceptionally adept at deductive reasoning and strategy. He finally used this understanding to defeat an Upper Rank demon and find the Transparent World, which enabled him to “see” his opponents as if they were standing right in front of him.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u2aba188340640a031d2e9fd2b2209450><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Explained : IS Gyomei Himejima The Strongest Hashira In Demon Slayer?</span></a><h3>The Nine Hashiras In Demon Slayer, Explained</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Nine-Hashira-1.jpg alt width=740 height=370 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Similar to how Muzan Kibutsuji gives power to Demon Slayer’s demons, each Hashira has their own special traits and skills, and they are all immensely strong. Each Demon Slayer Hashira employs a unique breathing technique that is drawn from one of the fundamental disciplines of Stone, Flame, Wind, Water, and Thunder, all of which are descended from the original Sun Breathing method. The Demon Slayer Corps consists of nine Hashiras, each of whom uses a unique breathing and fighting technique. Along with Gyomei Himejima, the Stone Hashira, there are other hashiras such as the Mist Hashira, Mitsuri Kanroji’s Love Hashira, Shinobu Kocho’s Insect Hashira, Sanemi Shinazugawa’s Wind Hashira, Obanai Iguro’s Serpent Hashira, Giyu Tomioka’s Water Hashira, Tengen Uzui’s Sound Up until now, the major characters of the Demon Slayer anime have been Shinobu and Tomioka, with the second season of the series focusing on Uzui and the Mugen Train Arc on Rengoku.</p><p>Gyomei Himejima has been acknowledged by Demon Slayers and demons alike as the most potent Hashira, even among such an excellent collection of Demon Slayer Hashira. Although Gyomei hasn’t yet had a major role in the Demon Slayer anime, Tanjiro and Inosuke both proclaimed him to be the Corps’ strongest Demon Slayer in the manga. Kokushibo, an Upper Rank 1 demon, has also stated that Gyomei Himejima is the best warrior he has fought in 300 years and that his talents are at their height right now. The fact that Gyomei was elevated to the honourable rank of Hashira so fast, and by the commander of the Demon Slayer Corps, no less, is another another indication of her power.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u8e5ff9b358b3b6520ee9081a1c6c037a><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Explained : IS Gyomei Himejima The Strongest Hashira In Demon Slayer?</span></a><p>While Giyu Tomioka and Sanemi Shinazugawa, two other Demon Slayer Hashiras, may not be far behind Gyomei Himejima in terms of swordsmanship, Gyomei Himejima’s calm nature completes him more than his rivals, who can be too volatile or too quiet. Gyomei begins to play a significant role in the manga after the Mugen Train arc, so it’s feasible that viewers will see more of Gyomei Himejima in action in the remaining seasons of Demon Slayer.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
