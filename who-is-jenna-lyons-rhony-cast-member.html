She was hired in 1990 when she was just 21 years old and worked her way up to the top to become president and creative director in 2008. She made the company so wildly popular that Michelle Obama famously wore (and name-checked!) the brand during her husband’s campaign trail. In a shocking turn, she <a href=#>stepped down from the role</a> in 2017 amid <a href=#>declining sales</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Lyons was dubbed “The Woman Who Dresses America” by the New York Times when she worked at J.Crew. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She has her own beauty brand.</h2><p>After her departure from J.Crew, Lyons took some time off. However, she returned in 2020 with the launch of her false eyelash company, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>LoveSeen</a>, which was inspired by her experience with incontinentia pigmenti. It’s a genetic disorder that’s left the designer with no eyelashes or eyebrows, bald spots in her hair, scars on her skin and all fake teeth, as she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the New Yorker</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The designer is known for her unique style, often wearing oversized button-up shirts and mixing masculine and feminine silhouettes. <span class=credit>Getty Images for W Magazine</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s been on reality TV before.</h2><p>In 2020, Lyons tried her hand at reality television with a documentary-style HBO Max show, <a href=#>“Stylish,”</a> that followed her growing design firm. It’s unclear if the show will be renewed for another season, though it’s likely the bespectacled star will simply showcase her business life on Bravo moving forward.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>3</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p class="ad__label ad__label--top">Advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/jenna-lyons1-.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/jenna-lyons9-.jpg><p><span class=screen-reader-text>Advertisement</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s no stranger to controversy.</h2><p>In 2011, Lyons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">came under fire</a> when she posed for a J.Crew ad while painting her then-4-year-old son Beckett’s toenails pink.</p><p>“Any 4-year-old, boy or girl, who watches their mothers’ toes go from nude to pink, they’re, like, ‘I want that,'” Lyons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the New Yorker</a> in 2020 of the backlash. “At 4, you don’t know color assigned by gender. There’s no meaning attached to anything. The idea that I was somehow trying to mess with his gender identity was just so absurd.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Lyons ruffled feathers with this 2011 J.Crew advertisement that included a photo of the designer painting son Beckett’s toenails a bright pink shade from the brand’s collaboration with Essie. <span class=credit>J.Crew</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s part of the LGBT community.</h2><p>In 2011, Lyons divorced her husband, Vincent Mazeau, after nine years of marriage. The couple shares son Beckett, who lives with Lyons in New York City. Shortly after her divorce, the fashion designer announced she was dating Courtney Crangi —&nbsp;the sister and business partner of jeweler Philip Crangi — though the couple broke up in 2017.</p><p>Fans are sure to tune in to see how Lyons fits in as a “Real Housewife.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYpHqqv4yjnKemkWK5urvNrGSroJ%2Bjxm6vwKyrZqWVoq%2Bmvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
