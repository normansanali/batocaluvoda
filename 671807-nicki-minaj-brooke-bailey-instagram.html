Moreover, the rapper posted some pictures of them together on her Instagram Story. "She my lil vibe my lil ah ah ah," she captioned the post. Of course, Bailey took to the comments section to hype themselves up even more as they enjoyed a glass of wine together in stylish fits. "<a href=# rel>Queen Tingz</a>," the reality star wrote under the post.</p><p>Unfortunately, the last news we heard from Brooke Bailey was much more tragic than a good time with Nicki Minaj. Back in September of 2022, she confirmed that her daughter Kayla <a href=# rel>lost her life in a car crash.</a> "Forever my baby, Pretty Black aka Kayla Nicole Bailey,” she expressed on Instagram. “This is not a goodbye. Mommy will see you soon." In a separate post, she thanked fans for their overwhelming support and condolences during that grueling time. Hopefully Minaj was also able to provide some light into her life, however minimal a drink together may seem at first glance.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-brooke-bailey-nicki-minaj-link-up>Brooke Bailey & Nicki Minaj Link Up</h2></span><p>"My baby girl is so loved by all of youuuuu!!!" Brooke Bailey wrote. "The love and support my family has received today is unreal and so appreciated. Thank you! Kayla left a mark on so many lives. She entered the room and demanded respect, love, and attention. If you had the pleasure of meeting her and being friends with her, she has forever changed your life. It was God preparing me for this moment in my life,” she remarked concerning her fasting and and praying just days before the tragedy, though she thought it was for something else. “Although I was not prepared. I am grateful for the 25 years he blessed me to have HIS child. To love her, to hold her, to teach her, to comfort her. She was my happiness on Earth." Sadly for Nicki Minaj, she also has <a href=# rel>her own experiences with grief</a>.</p><p>However, it's at least heartening to see the two have a good time and show each other love and support in that way. Amid a lot of <a href=# rel>new releases and drops</a> from the "Red Ruby Da Sleeze" MC, it can be hard to keep sight of that. While those wounds never truly heal, there is always the chance to move forward and keep those memories alive.
