When Nicole was five years old, her mother, who worked at a modeling agency, entered her into a beauty pageant, which she won. Shortly after the competition, a representative from Johnson’s Baby Shampoo approached her to appear in a commercial.</span></p><p><span>Shortly after, in 1979, she made her film debut in the movie When Hell Was in Session. The American drama film Rich and Famous, directed by George Cukor and released in 1981, offered her a role.
