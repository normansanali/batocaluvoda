It has experienced ups and downs, its heyday and its downs, but despite all of that, it is still relevant today, largely because of its exceptional capacity to tell love tales and make the audience laugh along the way. Of course, not every moviegoer prefers rom-coms, but the vast majority of viewers have looked to them at least once for upbeat, optimistic, straightforward material.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that rom-coms are predictable and replete with cliches. In nearly every movie, the main characters repeatedly act out the same narrative in which love prevails in the end. Nevertheless, rom-com fans continue to enjoy each and every new film because each director and cast brings a fresh viewpoint to the genre, as well as because we enjoy seeing love tales that could very well be our own.</p><p><a href=#>Romantic comedies</a> have managed to include some of Hollywood’s and the world’s top stars, from actors to directors and filmmakers, despite not being the most well-liked film genre. Hugh Grant, Drew Barrymore, Ashton Kutcher, and Julia Roberts are just a handful of the many actors who have acted in rom-coms through the years. And while the majority of these films are suitable for all viewers, there have been a few R-rated productions over the years with topics that are only appropriate for adult audiences. Here are the leading ten.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Bridget Jones’s Diary</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Friends with Benefits</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Love Actually</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Palm Springs</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Pretty Woman</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Punch-Drunk Love</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> There’s Something About Mary</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> When Harry Met Sally…</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Bridget_Jones8217s_Diary>Bridget Jones’s Diary<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bridget-Joness-Diary.jpg alt="romantic comedies rated r 2020,best romantic comedies rated r,romantic comedies rated r on netflix,romantic comedies rated r hollywood,romantic comedies rated r imdb,rated r movies,r rated comedies 2022,r rated romance movies imdb,r rated rom-coms on netflix,best r-rated romance movies on netflix,romance r rated movie 2022,rated 18 romantic comedy movies,romantic comedies rated r,rated r romantic comedies on netflix,r rated romantic comedy movies,romantic comedy rated pg,rotten tomatoes highest rated romantic comedies,r rated romantic comedies,romantic comedy highest rated,romantic comedies rated g" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Renée Zellweger received widespread recognition and her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her major role in the romantic comedy Bridget Jones’s Diary. The same-named novel by Helen Fielding, who also contributed to the writing for the movie along with Richard Curtis and Andrew Davis, served as the inspiration for this Sharon Maguire production. In Bridget Jones’s Diary, Bridget, a 30-year-old woman with a poor love life, decides to make a significant change in her life in 1999 in order to feel better about herself and find a spouse. She documents this decision in a diary. Soon, two men—one who looks to be the ideal partner and the other who, although appearing to be anything but ideal, yet appeals to her more than she would like to admit—start competing for her love.</p><p>Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Colin Firth, and Renee Zellweger all appear in this production with Zellweger. This romantic comedy was followed by two sequels, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and Bridget Jones’ Baby, which were equally successful at the box office.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u9d77702e7e64a080ecbbc76e9c984197><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>R-Rated Movies on Hulu: A Diverse Collection</span></a><h3><span id=Forgetting_Sarah_Marshall>Forgetting Sarah Marshall<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Forgetting-Sarah-Marshall.jpg alt="romantic comedies rated r 2020,best romantic comedies rated r,romantic comedies rated r on netflix,romantic comedies rated r hollywood,romantic comedies rated r imdb,rated r movies,r rated comedies 2022,r rated romance movies imdb,r rated rom-coms on netflix,best r-rated romance movies on netflix,romance r rated movie 2022,rated 18 romantic comedy movies,romantic comedies rated r,rated r romantic comedies on netflix,r rated romantic comedy movies,romantic comedy rated pg,rotten tomatoes highest rated romantic comedies,r rated romantic comedies,romantic comedy highest rated,romantic comedies rated g" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Over the years, Jason Segel and Judd Apatow have frequently worked together on a variety of projects.
