The&nbsp;"Dolemite Is My Name" actor began his speech by looking back at his illustrious career and thanking those who've helped him along the way, including his girlfriend, Paige&nbsp;Butcher, and his 10 "amazing" children. "I've been in show business for 46 years, and I've been in the movie business for 41 years, so this has been a long time in the making and greatly appreciated," he said (via <a href=#>E! Online</a>). He then went on to share his advice for&nbsp;all the new up-and-coming artists in the industry. "I wanna let you know that there is a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity, longevity, and peace of mind," he said. The blueprint, he added, was simple: pay your taxes, mind your business, and — in a not-so-subtle reference to Will Smith's Oscars 2022 meltdown —&nbsp;"Keep Will Smith's wife's name out your f—ing mouth!"</p><p>The surprise joke drew cheers from the audience and was met with an overwhelmingly positive response online.&nbsp;On <a href=#>Twitter</a>,&nbsp;journalist Sylvia Obell said,&nbsp;"Eddie Murphy would be the only person to make a Will Smith joke that was actually funny." However, Murphy has since clarified his speech to <a href=#>ET</a>&nbsp;and said that Smith, his wife Jada, and Chris Rock are all his friends. "I've worked with Jada," he said. "I love Will. I love Will. And I love Chris&nbsp;— and it's all love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmaIB5go6em52hlWK6tr7PobBmnZabvLPAy56qrKSpYr%2BwrdKtqmavmaG5br%2FMoquhZZGperW0xGZpaWpjYrSwuMOepWafnKSvpr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
