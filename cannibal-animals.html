In other instances, chimps of one community that have raided another community's territory will sometimes kill and eat the enemy (pictured).</span><span class=credit>BBC/YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Rabbit</h2><span class=caption-body>A wild mother rabbit will sometimes eat a stillborn baby if a predator is sensed to be nearby in an effort to keep her and her surviving bunnies safe, though sometimes, mothers have been known to eat their own in times of extreme hunger, thirst, or cold. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Praying Mantis</h2><span class=caption-body>When it comes to cannibal animals, most people think first of the praying mantis because of its mating ritual, in which the female will sometimes tear off the head of her male counterpart and eat it (pictured) in order to nourish herself in order to provide her soon-to-be gestating offspring. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Polar Bear</h2><span class=caption-body>Especially in recent years, polar bears been seen eating smaller, juvenile members of their own species in the wild (pictured).

This group includes the crab spider. These mothers will provide their young with unfertilized eggs, as well as her own body, to eat, in order to ensure the offspring’s survival (pictured).</span><span class=credit>National Geographic/YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Hamster</h2><span class=caption-body>Both male and female hamsters will sometimes eat their young.

It's because of her grisly mating habits, particularly the part where she kills and consumes the father of her babies shortly after mating. Black widow spider babies are also known for eating their own, with only a few of the several hundred offspring surviving at a time.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Tiger Salamander</h2><span class=caption-body>Tiger salamanders begin cannibalizing their own at the young age of just four weeks in an effort to both stay fed and keep the population low enough so that food shortages won't become a problem.<p>Pictured: The tail of one tiger salamander larva sticks out of the mouth of another tiger salamander just after being cannibalized.</p></span><span class=credit>California Department of Fish and Wildlife/Flickr</span><h2 class=title>Nematode</h2><span class=caption-body>The hermaphroditic nematode, or roundworm, self-fertilizes to create hundreds of eggs at a time.

Then, once the babies are born, some of the females begin eating their brothers in order to cull the brood, given that only a few males are needed to father the next generation. </span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Polar beat eating a bear Cannibal animals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/polar-bear-eating.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 15 Cannibalistic Animals That Eat Their Own For A Variety Of Disturbing Reasons View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>Cannibalism remains one of the most enduring and universal taboos in all of Western culture. While the idea of eating one's own kind is often met with disgust among humans, the practice is actually quite common among certain members of the animal kingdom.</p><p>The eating habits of these cannibal animals all tend to stem from an inherent survival instinct, and most instances occur either right around the birth of young or shortly after copulation. The mating habits of the <a href=# rel=noopener>praying mantis</a>, and several species of spiders, for example, will sometimes involve the female of the pair bite off and consume the head of her mate shortly after becoming inseminated in an effort to nourish herself and prepare her body for gestating offspring.</p><p>Other cannibal animals will eat their own babies, for a variety of reasons. Some will turn to their own as a food source when rations elsewhere are scarce, as is the case with scorpions, who can have around 100 offspring to provide for. By sacrificing a few, the mother gives the majority of the group a better chance at survival.</p><p>Some animal mothers, mainly nesting animals such as rabbits and hamsters, will eat sickly, weak, or dead babies left in the nesting area in an effort to deter predators, who would be lured in by the smell, from entering their domain.</p><p>In a few instances, however, it's the young who turn on their mothers. Known as <a href=# rel=noopener>matriphagy</a>, this occurrence is usually the result of extreme acts of self-sacrifice, in which the mother offers her own body for the sake of the survival of the next generation.</p><p>Some mothers will offer their bodies as a shelter for their young ones, who are forced to eat their way out from the inside. Meanwhile, certain animals, like the crab spider, even leave unfertilized eggs for their young to eat before they finish off her own body. It's a slow death but one that can result in higher survival rates for the young in the long run — horrifying yet practical, like so much of the cannibalism in the animal kingdom.</p><p>After this look at cannibal animals, read up on the <a href=#>Donner Party</a>, responsible for the most infamous act of mass cannibalism in American history.
