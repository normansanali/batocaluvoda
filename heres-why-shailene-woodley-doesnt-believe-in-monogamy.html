She told <a href=#>Marie Claire</a> in 2014, "I don't even know if humans are genetically made to be with one person forever."&nbsp;The Secret Life of the American Teenager alum isn't the only star who has expressed similar opinions. In fact, a lot of well known <a href=#>celebrities also don't necessarily believe in monogamy.</a></p><p>Woodley's opinions on the subject haven't changed, even after she said (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a>) that she "has experienced both an open relationship and a <a href=#>deeply monogamous relationship</a>." She went on to say that it's up to the people in the relationship to decide what's right for them and that said experiences don't have to fit within the boundaries society has established.&nbsp;"[T]here has to be a level of responsibility in any relationship dynamic, and that responsibility is simply honesty and communication and trust," Woodley added. "Apart from that, it's really none of our business what people choose to do with their lives."</p><p>The Adrift&nbsp;star added that "we're societally conditioned to assume that one person can be our end-all, be-all." And it's clear&nbsp;that Woodley infuses every aspect of her life with that same dedication to honesty, as she's demonstrated she's not afraid to speak her mind!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25oZn12e8eeqZ6rXay1unnSoZiipJWjsm7DzqibpZ2pYrGwsdKnq2aalaG2psLEZqCnZZ2ku7CzwKawaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
