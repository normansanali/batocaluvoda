This article delves into the fascinating relationship between two key figures during this tumultuous period – Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/carter-hu.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Context_of_the_Cold_War_in_Africa></span><strong>Context of the Cold War in Africa </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The year was 1976, and Africa found itself at the epicenter of the Cold War. With 36,000 Cubans entering Angola and Jimmy Carter contending for the presidency, Henry Kissinger embarked on a diplomatic mission to forge peace in Rhodesia. This endeavor, however, would unravel against the backdrop of one of America’s most sensitive domestic issues – racism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carters_Astute_Policy_in_Rhodesia></span><strong>Carter’s Astute Policy in Rhodesia </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carter’s administration, in collaboration with the British and African leaders, played a pivotal role in steering Rhodesia towards independence. The essence of American foreign policy, aimed at halting Soviet expansion, collided with the explosive issue of racism in Rhodesia. Carter’s strategic foresight in dealing with this crisis stands in stark contrast to his less successful approach to the Horn of Africa conflict.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Contrasting_Foreign_Policy_Approaches></span><strong>Contrasting Foreign Policy Approaches </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carter’s effective anticipation of the Rhodesian crisis and cooperation with London showcased his administration’s diplomatic strengths. In contrast, the inadequate preparation for the Horn of Africa conflict exposed the pitfalls of relying on inept advice from European partners. This divergence sheds light on the intricacies of Carter’s foreign policy decisions during a critical period.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Insights_from_Candid_Interviews></span><strong>Insights from Candid Interviews </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Drawing on candid interviews with Carter and key diplomats, as well as extensive international archival sources, this study reevaluates both Kissinger and Carter’s strengths and weaknesses.

Her study, based on the clash between German and American imperialism in Latin America, informs the analysis of Carter and Kissinger’s interactions in the African context. Mitchell’s expertise enriches our understanding of the broader historical context.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=James_G_Hershbergs_Chairmanship></span><strong>James G.
