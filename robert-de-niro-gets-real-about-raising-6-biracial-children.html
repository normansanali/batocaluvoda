That’s scary. That has to change.”</p><p>De Niro also weighed in on the widespread protests against police brutality and racial inequality taking place throughout the U.S. and around the world. The demonstrations began in the wake of George Floyd’s death while in police custody in May.</p><p>“We had all the protests and everything going on, rightfully so, people are so angry that they did not care. They said, ‘I’m going out anyway,'” the Goodfellas star said. “I think a lot of people did wear masks, it seems that way. But that’s how angry everybody was.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Robert-De-Niro-Gets-Real-About-Raising-Six-Biracial-Children-Inline.jpg><p>De Niro and his ex-wife <strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong> share daughter Drena, 48, and son Raphael, 44.
