Here's what we know.</h2><p>The Leviathan Axe first appeared in Fortnite as a pickaxe during Chapter 2 Season 5 of the game in December 2020. It came as part of the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oathbreaker Set</a>" and could be purchased along with an exclusive Kratos Skin. Along with the Axe, the Oathbreaker set also came with a Guardian Shield Glider and a backpack made to emulate Kratos' beheaded companion, Mimir. As a bonus, players who purchased the Kratos outfit on the <a href=#>PlayStation 5</a> received a special armored Kratos skin.</p><p>The God of War collab items, including the Axe, were only available in the Item Shop for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">limited time</a>. They were available from December 2020 until early January 2021. They made another brief appearance in the shop again in March of the same year before being removed once more. To date, they have yet to make another return to the shop.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Leviathan Axe was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly rumored</a> to be making a return in November 2022 to coincide with the hotly-anticipated release of <a href=#>God of War: Ragnarök</a> on the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Unfortunately, these rumors were ultimately debunked after the Axe made no such appearance as the year came to a close.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Yet, the Leviathan Axe still remains a highly-requested commodity among Fortnite players. Many have taken to Twitter posts on the game's official account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commenting</a> for the dev team at Epic Games to bring back the Leviathan Axe at some point. However, there seems to be no explicit sign that the Leviathan Axe will return to Fortnite any time soon.</p><p>Though Fortnite may have missed the boat on bringing back the Axe to celebrate the release of Ragnarök, there may yet be an opportunity for it to come back in the future. A <a href=#>New Game Plus</a> mode for the sequel is set to release in the spring, so there's still a chance for the Leviathan Axe to make another comeback.</p><p>Fortnite is available on all major gaming platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeZKWdpp6utbTAp2SasJVisLC5yKeeZpqRmLhuwM5mnaiqpKO2tbE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
