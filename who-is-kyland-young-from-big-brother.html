As far as the show goes, Kyland said he's "most excited about playing the game." He explained, "I get excited about the competitions and the social strategies <a href=#>that can help you win</a>! I have always been good at building relationships and being persuasive, however, to have those things gamified in a way that I can be ranked by how well I do it, is like an injection into my competitive blood!"</p><p dir=ltr>Kyland added that he has <a href=#>watched the show in the past</a> and is a fan of Derrick Levasseur and Cody Calafiore from Season 16, as well as Tyler Crispen and Kaycee Clark from Season 20. As for his favorite past moment, Kyland revealed to CBS that he was "blown away by Dan's funeral play in Season 14." However, he admitted that it's hard "not knowing anything about what's happening with my family" whom he says he's "extremely close to."</p><p dir=ltr>Yet Kyland is in it to win it and says he's been "studying the game" and "preparing mentally and physically." He also dished that part of his strategy is to "not give away that I'm as good as I think I will be." While Kyland admits that it may sound arrogant, he believes, "the self-awareness I employ in my life in general makes me feel this is all possible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5haoV3e9ahpmaho2K4urjAp5tmsZ%2Bqu6h5xaumpmWSnrRurtGoq6GdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
