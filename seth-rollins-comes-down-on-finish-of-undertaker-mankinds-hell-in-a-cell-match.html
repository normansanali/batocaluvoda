This is something he might want to let go of.</p><p>David Weissman made a comment that Seth Rollins’ match against Bray Wyatt at Crown Jewel might end in a DQ. This was after their Hell In A Cell match ended with referee stoppage which was a point the Architect had to make.</p><p>Correction: it ended in a ref stoppage. When a body isn’t moving, the official has to make the right call.</p><p>Rollins then received a reply that was simply an animated gif of The Undertaker throwing Mankind off of the Hell In A Cell structure from their famous match over 21 years ago. This caused Seth Rollins to reply that the referee should have probably stopped that match as well.</p><p>I imagine Mick and Taker might have liked the ref to stop the match there. Might have added a few more years to Mick’s incredible career. Just a thought.</p><p>It seems like fans aren’t going to let Seth Rollins live down retaining the Universal Title at Hell In A Cell. As long as he keeps defending WWE’s creative decision there will likely be fans who keep coming up with legitimate holes in their logic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
