It’s a lot easier for us [men].”</p><p>The Oscar winner, who shares son Levi, 11, daughter Vida, 10, and <a href=#>son Livingston</a>, 7, with the model, 38, added that “the only thing [he] ever knew [he wanted] since he was 8 years old was to “be a dad.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Camila-Alves-and-Matthew-McConaughey-More-Kids-2.jpg><p>Since welcoming his and Alves’ kids, the Texas native has played “a large hand in shepherding” the little ones. “That’s the thing I think I do most honorably is having three autonomous, conscientious, confident children,” he gushed.</p><p>The Interstellar star loves bringing his children to set, but revealed that he “puts them to work” every time they come out. “We give them a little cash for catering,” McConaughey said on Saturday. “My daughter’s gone in to work with seamstresses and the costume departments.”</p><p>That isn’t the only way that his acting experience has shifted since becoming a father. “The character I am in my life, the man I am in my life, the story I’m living is more violent than the characters in the stories that I feel like I’m playing in some of these romantic comedies,” the True Detective alum reflected. “So, I took off in kind of an un-branding phase. Not a rebranding phase, an un-branding phase.&nbsp;By being away, by un-branding, then all of a sudden, things came to me that I was wanting to do. Dramatic roles that I’d been pursuing that weren’t coming my way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Camila-Alves-and-Matthew-McConaughey-More-Kids.jpg><p>The producer added, “Then I went on a run with&nbsp;<i>Killer Joe</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mud</i>,&nbsp;<i>Magic Mike</i>. I got ahold of&nbsp;<i>Dallas Buyers Club</i>, but no one wanted to make it with me. Then we made that. For about 11 years I’ve been on a run that I’ve been enjoying.”</p><p><a href=#>McConaughey and Alves wed in June 201</a>2 at their home in Austin, Texas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKaanKeelsKotMSyZLCnpaGxbrTAr5xmcF2ivLOxjKSgnatdnrNuw8ifnGavkah6sLqMm6aaqpRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
