If it weren’t for the Real Housewives, the masses wouldn’t know the names <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>, Heather Gay, or <a href=#>Linnethia “NeNe” Leakes</a>. Facts are facts.</p><p><a href=#>Bethenny Frankel</a> is another person whose name didn’t carry the same weight before she joined the cast of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New York City</a>.</p><p>During her time on RHONY, Bethenny gained a <a href=#>net worth of $70 Million</a>, a lucrative Skinny alcoholic beverage line, a talk show, and now, a podcast. A large part of Bethenny’s success has been credited to Andy, who hired Bethenny to be one of RHONY’s OG cast members in 2008. However, the two have been on the outs for quite some time, which Andy addressed in June 2024.</p><p>So, what happened between Andy and Bethenny? Here’s the scoop on their feud.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@bethennyfrankel, @bravoandy</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why are Andy Cohen and Bethenny Frankel feuding?</h2><p>While some employees like to steer clear from their bosses outside of work hours, the same isn’t the case in reality TV or any other entertainment genre. Andy and Bethenny, for instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">became fast friends</a> while she was on the show. However, their drama began when Andy expressed disappointment in Bethenny’s post-RHONY venture.</p><p>After officially leaving<a href=#> the series in 2019</a>, Bethenny shared some not-so-nice things about Andy and Housewives in interviews and on social media. Fans of both parties felt Bethenny’s comments strained their relationship, which Andy confirmed to be true in 2022.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>When Bethenny appeared on an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live</a> alongside <a href=#>Jeff Lewis</a>, Andy confronted her about her comments and her decision to launch a Housewives rewatch podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ReWives</a>. He said he felt Bethenny’s actions were “kind of hypocritical” for “embracing the Housewives” now after seemingly not doing so, causing Bethenny to push back.</p><p>“I actually haven't been trashing the show - I said it wasn't for me because I do think it was toxic, and I'm entitled to not want to be there but still want to talk about it ... how could I be on for more than a decade and not have reflections to share? I'm not trashing people on the show.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Bethenny Frankel and Andy Cohen’s feud continued after her “reality reckoning” in 2023.</h2><p>Andy and Bethenny’s WWHL blowup began the former friends’ ongoing drama. In July 2023, the Bethenny Ever After star took to her Instagram account to discuss alleged money Andy and Bravo owe her from her time on RHONY.</p><p>During the <a href=#>SAG-AFTRA writers and actors strike</a> in Summer 2023, Bethenny stated she and her fellow reality stars were also “getting screwed” out of royalties she felt she had acquired. She then spearheaded a “reality reckoning” that would result in the unionization of reality TV. Some of Bethenny’s demands included “residual-esque payments for networks playing hit reality shows over and over, a minimum salary of $5,000 per episode, and that stars get a 10 percent raise every season,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mashable</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bethennyfrankel href=#>@bethennyfrankel</a><p>We deserve a response from the entertainment industry acknowledging that we have been heard. <a title=strike href=#>#strike</a> <a title=union href=#>#union</a> <a title=realityreckoning href=#>#realityreckoning</a> <a title=thebethennyclause href=#>#thebethennyclause</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Bethenny Frankel" href=#>♬ original sound - Bethenny Frankel</a></figure><p>Bethenny was firm in her stance against the reality reckoning for several months. In December 2023, when asked how the reckoning would affect her and Andy’s relationship, she said, “He didn’t make me a star; he made himself a star on the backs of all of these women.”</p><p>Over time, she became less vocal about the reckoning, something <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans have criticized</a>. Andy, however, has shared his take on his former friend’s actions, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> in June 2024 that he felt the reckoning was a “sustained attack” against him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">In 2024, Andy and Bethenny want to move on from their feud.</h2><p>While Andy and Bethenny may never have the same relationship as they did during The Real Housewives glory days, they both seem ready to keep one another’s names at least out of their mouths.</p><p>In his Vulture interview, Andy didn’t name Bethenny directly but said the “noise” surrounding Bethenny’s claims was “definitely sad about.” Nonetheless, the Bravo star has enough on his plate with <a href=#>ongoing lawsuits</a> involving other former Housewives stars, Brandi Glanville, Leah McSweeney, and <a href=#>Caroline Manzo</a>.</p><p>Bethenny also expressed her willingness to move on. When asked to speak on her and Andy’s feud to Vulture, she declined, with her publicist reportedly telling the outlet, “This story is so ol, lol.”</p><p>I guess this feud doesn’t need a reunion to end, or at least “pause.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrulxYycpqGdnmKvpsDHnqWnsV2bv6K6yp6jZp6VqrE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
