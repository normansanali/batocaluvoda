The app gets the best of them and what's worse is it makes the group and their loved ones a live target.</p><p>With zero clue in knowing what is actually happening around them and with no one to believe them, the gang tries to escape the deadly consequences on their own while trying to find the truth. This is when a saviour comes in the form of Jaya (played by ), an intelligent young woman with a knack for codes, who helps the group in finding out about the mysterious and sinister person behind the curtain.

Will 'Red Rose' come to the spotlight?</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><h2 class=split>Did Jaya start following The Gardner?</h2><p>Jaya is the character in 'Red Rose' who changed the trajectory of the story by exposing the group to the existence of the dark web and the role of Red Rose in it. She tracks down the origin of the Red Rose with her exceptional computer skills. Jaya is also the one who finds out about Simon's (boyfriend of Wren's mother) involvement with the Red Rose. Everyone believes Simon is the high-ranking member of Red Rose (named The Gardner) and closes the case. But it is Jaya, who kept on working the case, finds out the Red Rose is still working and she even met the mysterious The Gardner. It becomes clear that with this persistent attitude, Jaya will not sleep and she will always keep a tab on the deadly Red Rose, even though she has deleted its existence. Jaya is aware of the newer version of Red Rose now starting to bloom in Tokyo and will try to take it down as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e9edae88-a239-4f55-b9c0-4a790ff36fcf.png><h2 class=split>Is Jaya's life in danger?</h2><p>Jaya is fearless, intelligent and consistent throughout the series which makes her a threat to Red Rose. After the deadly group of Red Rose finds out about Jaya's breaching into their website and helping her friends to escape from the plans of Red Rose, they try to kill Jaya by setting fire to her house. Though Jaya escapes and secretly helps the gang till the end, Jaya becomes a target once again by coming in direct contact with The Gardner at the end. Now, Jaya knows about The Gardner's identity.

With Red Rose now expanding to a larger scale, the dark web group runs a chance of being exposed to the public.</p><p>The final scene in Tokyo has opened up the world of 'Red Rose' on a larger scale, with endless possibilities.
