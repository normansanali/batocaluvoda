Bianca Belair has decided that she wants fewer tattoos, but it is a very painful process to get that done.</p><p>Bianca Belair posted several videos on her Instagram story of herself in a chair getting a tattoo removal done. Her husband, Montez Ford was by her side, and he offered words of support.</p><p>The EST of WWE is going through this process to get the stars removed from her side. It was also a terrible experience, and she sent out a warning in the process.</p><p>“Just a reminder. Think before you get tattoos lol. It’s not worth it!!!!! I felt like my skin was melting. I hate this tattoo Hopefully it goes away forever, but it’s color so it’s not 100% guaranteed.“</p><p>Bianca Belair posted a longer text graphic to her Instagram stories that told fans everything she’s going through. She wants to be an example for fans, and sharing this life experience may help some of her younger followers out, for sure.</p><p>I will keep y’all updated. I got unlimited sessions so I will keep going until it disappears or gets as close as it can to be gone. I was super nervous about it because I am black and I’ve heard the laser can discolor our skin but we will see what happens. I am also prone to keloids… so far after 1 session it’s fine. It has faded a little and the black outline has gone away on a lot of the stars.</p><p>Bianca Belair noted in another video that, “LMAO I was in there screaming.” Removing tattoos is more painful than getting them, as lasers are used to literally burn skin until it gets to the layers where the ink resides.</p><p>After her first treatment, Bianca Belair also reported that she is far from finished with this process. “It def wasn’t gone after this 1 treatment. The only thing gone as of now is some of the black outlines on the stars and cupcake.”</p><p>You can check out the video below. We’ve seen Bianca Belair go through some pain before, but this is hard to watch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><p>What’s your take on getting tattoos removed?
