I get to see them when we can,” he told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> of keeping in touch with his TV family. “We all love each other. I just don’t think that that’s … it’s kind of low on the possibilities.”</p><p>While Saget, 56, kept things classy in a dark suit and spotted navy tie, it was Cameron Bure, 37, who stole the spotlight. The actress, who played older sister DJ Tanner on the ’90s sitcom, looked sexy and polished in a fitted coral short-sleeve leather mini dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>According to an eyewitness, Cameron Bure excitedly hugged Saget at the benefit event and the pair chatted happily as cameras snapped away. Sweetin, 31, also lit up the carpet with her trademark bright smile (she played younger sister Stephanie on the show), opting for a black floor-length dress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cameron Bure has three children with her husband, hockey star Valeri Bure; Sweetin overcame a serious methamphetamine addiction, and now has two kids (one with ex-husband Cody Herpin, and one with second husband Morty Coyle). The former costars talked animatedly and laughed as they caught up, the eyewitness told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Saget told <strong>Us</strong> that though his real-life daughters — Lara, Aubrey and Jennifer — are fans of his comedy, they’re not necessarily itching to follow in his acting footsteps anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re intelligent. They’re Ivy-League graduates, they’re real smart and they’re artists and their art is edgy,” the veteran comedian told Us. “They’re just cool people. They know how to perform and speak [but] they don’t want to do it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGain5m2pnnSsJyerJmjeqO7wWaqmp%2BVqXqprdWeZJ%2BtnKF6qbvUrJxmqpWqu6q7zWanopukqr%2Bmv4xrZ2prYWp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
