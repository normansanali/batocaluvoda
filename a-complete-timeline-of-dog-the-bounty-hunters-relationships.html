As he recounted in his&nbsp;autobiography "<a href=#>You Can Run, But You Can't Hide</a>," he&nbsp;met Ann Tegnell at a biker party in Colorado that same year, and the two hit it off.</p><p dir=ltr>According to Duane, the two left the party together that night. When he offered to drive Tegnell home after they'd been intimate, she revealed she was 17 years old. In an attempt to avoid any more jail time, Duane,&nbsp;who was on parole for his 1976 murder sentence, married Tegnell the next day. For the pair, who literally only knew each other for days, their connection was not a match made in heaven. "We didn't know each other at all. We were both so young and we probably wouldn't have gotten married if she hadn't been underage when we met," Duane explained in "You Can Run, But You Can't Hide."</p><p dir=ltr>Despite having a less than ideal marriage, Duane and Tegnell had three children together. Their first child, Zebediah Chapman, died on January 31, 1980, shortly after his birth, per <a href=#>ET</a>. The couple had two more sons, Wesley Chapman (born 1980) and James Chapman (born 1982), during their on-again, off-again relationship before splitting permanently in 1982, as reported by <a href=#>The Mirror</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm5oaoV2e8BmmqiloKGytbGMraCmnZyeu6Z5zp9knaeXYsGpsYybpq6mpK56qcHNrZyrq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr20ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
