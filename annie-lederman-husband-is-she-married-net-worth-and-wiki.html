However, it appears that the comic has no plans to reveal her personal life in public.</strong></p><p>Annie, who frequently expressed her real-life problems in her humor, is accused of keeping her followers in the dark about covert romances and relationships. Is this right? Or does the comedian have other plans that we don’t know about? Let’s find out who Annie’s boyfriend is and more about her, such as her net worth.</p><h2><span id=Is_Annie_Lederman_in_a_Relationship>Is Annie Lederman in a Relationship?</span></h2><p>We can’t rule out the possibility that Annie has previously married due to the way she covers her love life. However, according to multiple sources and periodicals, the Girl Code comic is not married and has no plans to marry anytime soon. Given her present silence on her wedding plans, it’s safe to assume Annie is on her own journey to climb the success ladder at what she does.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Annie_Ledermans_Boyfriend>Who Is Annie Lederman’s Boyfriend?</span></h2><p>She is currently seeing Todd Walker, according to reports. According to their social media sites, Todd and Annie have been dating since the early 2020s. In an interview, Annie stated that their relationship began formally during the outbreak and has been going well since then.</p><p>Since late 2020, they’ve been sharing one other’s photographs on social media, and Lederman’s unwavering love for her lover is evident. She frequently praised her lover as the sweetest man who helped her crack the code of life.</p><p>Todd, on the other hand, is competing on social media to demonstrate his affection for her girlfriend Annie. Todd and Annie aren’t the only ones who post about their feelings for one other on social media. Wayne Walker, Todd’s father, occasionally compliments their affection.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Ledermans_Bf_Todd_Walker>Who Is Lederman’s Bf Todd Walker?</span></h2><p>Todd is a producer and an editor. He is frequently seen performing alongside Ledderman in her concerts. He is also the owner of Walker Media LLC. Walker was born in New Jersey and is the son of Wayne and Vanessa Walker. He has two younger brothers and sisters. Lederman’s sweetheart went to Temple University after graduating from Manchester Township High School. In an interview, Annie purportedly stated that her spouse is half-Asian.</p><h2><span id=Annie_Ledderman_has_previously_dated_Ben_Stewart>Annie Ledderman has previously dated Ben Stewart</span></h2><p>Before her relationship with Todd, Annie dated a man named Ben Stewart. According to media sources, the ex-couple began dating in 2016. During their romance, the two were quite active on Twitter (now X). They were frequently found mentioning each other in their tweets. Annie, who frequently mentions her current partner in her shows, used to make fun of her ex-boyfriend Ben while they were together.</p><p>Annie published her ex-boyfriend’s rollerblading video on May 16, 2016, with the caption,</p><p><strong>“The hardest part of your boyfriend being a rollerblader is trying to convince your parents he’s not gay”</strong></p><p>However, nothing is spoken regarding the ex-flame relationship, and no specific grounds for their divorce are mentioned. Some fans believe the ex-couple split up because Annie couldn’t persuade her parents that Ben wasn’t homosexual.</p><h2><span id=Annie_Lederman_Net_Worth>Annie Lederman Net Worth</span></h2><p>Annie’s net worth is $1 million as of 2023. Her main professional endeavors, such as acting, comedy, and hosting, all contribute to her net worth. Lederman has a big following on Instagram and YouTube.
