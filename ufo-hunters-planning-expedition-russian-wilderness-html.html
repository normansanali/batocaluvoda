Lake Baikal is the world’s deepest lake and many UFO enthusiasts believe their chances for spotting an alien disc are greater around the Russian lake. The group is made up of 50 individuals who call themselves the “Trans-Eurasian UFO-Search Expedition.” They all share the same objective to sight an alien spacecraft.</p><p>One of the group’s members, <a href=#>Vladimir Kuznetsov came equipped</a> with a homemade gadget that he believes helps him look for UFOs by monitoring radiation and infrared emissions. The specialized device looks like E.T.’s Speak & Spell communication apparatus he used to “phone home.” Kuzentsov also believes Lake Baikal was the site of a previous UFO sighting:</p><p>Here, in 1958 there was a TU-154 airplane crash. There were some reports from the locals that a UFO pursued the aircraft till it reached Baikal waters right here. And there were frequent reports of UFO activity around Baikal. So this is the reason why we decided to meet here. I hope that we will be lucky enough to shoot something interesting.</p><p>Two members of the Trans-Eurasian UFO-Search Expedition, Anastasia and Andrey Chernobrov, have claimed they have already spotted a UFO during their expedition and have captured the moment with their camera.</p><p>At first the object did not move, but it had a peculiar glow, flashing with different colors – blue, red, yellow, green… We started watching it, and a few minutes afterwards the object began to move chaotically, not like a helicopter, or a plane, or any other terrestrial machine which can fly,” Chernobrov said.</p><p>Here’s a video look at what they’ve been up to so far…</p><p>The Trans-Eurasian UFO-Search Expedition started their journey in July with a trip to Russky Island in the Sea of Japan off Russia’s Vladivostok. The group plans to finish their extraterrestrial excursion in Moscow in September.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue9KcoGitlqR6qcHNrZyrq12luaK6zaKloGWVrb2msMitoKimXafCtL%2FImqVmr5mhsaa%2BzZ6qrGaYqbqt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
