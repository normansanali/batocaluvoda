However, in the most recent episode of the epic action-packed series, Fitz's wife Jemma Simmons (Elizabeth Henstridge) dropped a slight clue as to the location of the scientist.</p><p>Keep reading to find out more about where the agent ended up in the comic book series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Fitz on 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'?</h2><p>Jemma began experiencing problems with her memory in the recent episode "Adapt or Die," and decided to ask her ally Enoch (Joel Stoffer) for help on fixing the memory device implanted in her brain. However, when Deke Shaw (Jeff Ward) saw the Chronicom performing surgery on Jemma, he immediately knocked him out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>When Jemma came to, she revealed to Deke that Enoch was helping to fix her memory so they could fix the ship. She also revealed: &nbsp;"You cannot imagine how impossible it was to track the Chronicoms through time, but Fitz and I found a place where all their moves could be observed. To guide us, Fitz stayed there. He is completely exposed and they will kill him if they find him, so no one can know his location."&nbsp;</p><p>The biochemist also revealed that she does indeed know her husband's location, but designed an implant to help suppress her memories, which she named Diana.</p><p>Jemma explained to her grandson that she's worried about remembering Fitz's location, which would put him in danger. Adding, "Diana is acting up, and I'm forgetting the things I'm supposed to know and, more dangerously, I'm remembering the things I'm not."</p><p>So, while viewers are still unsure of Fitz's exact location, Jemma's small clue seemed to suggest that he is at the mercy of the Chronicoms. Will we finally get answers in Season 7?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' fans are hoping to see Fitz return in Season 7.</h2><p>When will Fitz and Jemma finally reunite?
