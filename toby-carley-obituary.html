He worked at ABC Lumber, Northwoods Lumber, Burnett Dairy, Anderson Construction, Luck School District and Burnett Dairy. He enjoyed working at Anderson Construction throughout the summers while he was a teacher and a high school and college student.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Toby-Carley-.jpg><p>He learnt a lot about construction there. He had a fulfilling 23-year career as an athletic director, football and wrestling coach and teacher in the Luck School District. Following that, he worked for Grantsburg’s Burnett Dairy and ABC Lumber, Webster’s Northwoods Lumber and, most recently, as a solo contractor, doing whatever was required of him.</p><p>Toby took great pride in his voluntary work with the fire departments of both Frederic and Grantsburg, where he had previously lived.
