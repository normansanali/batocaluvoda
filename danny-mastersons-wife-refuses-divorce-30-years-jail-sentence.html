In a courtroom sketch, the actor was observed blowing a kiss to his wife just before being escorted to prison.</p><p>While Bijou may be working with her husband and his legal team to explore their options, an earlier report said the actress was shocked when he was given a three-decade sentence.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Danny Masterson The Highest-Paid Cast Member On That '70s Show?</a></span></p><p>“She wasn’t prepared for the verdict,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said in June</a>, after Danny was found guilty of two counts of rape. “She never expected him to be found guilty.

Bijou, 43, and Danny, 47, have been married since 2011.</p><p>In 2020, Masterson faced charges of forcibly raping three women in separate incidents between 2001 and 2003. Following his arrest, he remained free on a $3.3 million bail.
