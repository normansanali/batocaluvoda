Later, in October 2020, he was designated as a special counsel for the Department of Justice to lead the inquiry. Prior to his appointment as U.S. Attorney, Durham had an illustrious 35-year tenure as an assistant U.S. attorney in different roles in D.C. Notably, he served as a special prosecutor in the investigation of the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes in 2005.</p><p>Attorney General William Barr entrusted Durham with the responsibility of reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation and ensuring the lawfulness and appropriateness of intelligence collection related to the Trump campaign.</p><p>In December 2020, Barr elevated Durham’s status to special counsel, ensuring the continuity of the investigation beyond the Trump administration. Throughout his extensive investigation, which spanned over three and a half years, Durham secured one guilty plea and a probation sentence for a charge unrelated to the Russia investigation’s origins. Additionally, he pursued two trials, alleging that the FBI had been deceived by the defendants.</p><p>John Durham’s educational background includes a Bachelor of Arts degree from Colgate University in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1975. Following his graduation, he dedicated two years as a VISTA volunteer on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana from 1975 to 1977.</p><p>The investigations led by John Durham were part of a larger political discourse surrounding the FBI’s actions during the 2016 election. Critics, including former President Trump and his allies, raised concerns about the FBI investigation known as Crossfire Hurricane, which eventually led to the Mueller investigation. In response to these concerns, Attorney General Barr initiated a review, appointing Durham to lead it. The investigation focused on scrutinizing the government’s collection of intelligence involving interactions between the Trump campaign and Russians.</p><p>On May 15, 2023, John Durham released the “Report on matters related to intelligence activities and Investigations arising out of the 2016 Presidential Campaigns.”</p><p>The report criticized the FBI and concluded that launching a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election was unwarranted. It also highlighted the FBI’s use of raw and uncorroborated intelligence, raising concerns about potential bias in the handling of the investigations related to Trump and Clinton’s campaigns.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is John Durham’s Net Worth?</h2><p>As of 2022, details about his net worth were not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsButs6hpWacpae1ornSZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
