However, she insisted that nepotism never landed her a role.</p><p>“The internet seems to care a lot about that kind of stuff. People are going to have preconceived ideas about you or how you got there, and I can definitely say that nothing is going to get you the part except for being right for the part,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Elle</i></a> in December 2022.</p><p>She added, “The internet cares a lot more about <a href=#>who your family is</a> than the people who are casting you in things. Maybe you get your foot in the door, but you still just have your foot in the door. There’s a lot of work that comes after that.”</p><p>Frankel, who shares Bryn, 13, with ex-husband <b>Jason Hoppy</b>, may be rough around the edges with her daughter but she draws the line at criticism from outsiders. She <a href=#>had a message for haters</a> who criticized Bryn’s fashion sense along with her own parenting skills.</p><a title=@bethennyfrankel href=#>@bethennyfrankel</a><p><a title="♬ original sound - Bethenny Frankel" href=#>♬ original sound – Bethenny Frankel</a></p><p>“Some people think it’s their business how I parent and how my daughter dresses,” Frankel said in an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video in March. “[My fans] will come and f— you up if you come and talk about my child. The one thing you cannot criticize is my parenting. You better keep f— walking and take a seat because I will come to your house and I will f— you up myself.”</p><p>The reality TV star went on to describe her “nearly perfect” daughter. “I have the most beautiful, thoughtful, caring, loving, spiritual, sensitive, darling, loving, smart human being for a child,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This may feel aggressive and I do not believe in physical altercation but when it comes to protecting my daughter do not cross me,” she captioned the post.</p><p>Frankel’s relationship with her daughter may be strong, but the <i>RHONY </i>star has been going through relationship trouble elsewhere. Earlier this month, <a href=#><i>Us Weekly </i></a>confirmed that Frankel and<i> </i><b>Paul Bernon </b>split after six years of dating.</p><p>A mutual friend of the couple told <i>Us</i> that “it just wasn’t going to work” between the long-time couple. “They are so different — he’s an under the radar kind of guy,” the insider said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtedGomKyso2KxosHGoaueql2Xv7q6jLCfnqZdlsCsscNmrqGZpGKubrrEqaZmmpGXxm610mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
