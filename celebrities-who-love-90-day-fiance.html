While some have counted themselves as fans since the series’ premiere, others are finding their footing later on while discovering the <a href=#>show’s numerous spinoffs</a>.&nbsp;Either way, they’re welcomed with open arms by the 90 Day Fiancé fandom.</p><p>The TLC series follows couples who have either applied for or received their K-1 visa, which is only available to United States citizens’ foreign fiancés. The duos —&nbsp;many of whom have not met IRL before getting engaged — have 90 days to marry each other, the timeline of which is captured perfectly by cameras.</p><p>Since the original 90 Day Fiancé show premiered in 2014, spinoffs such as 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After, 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk and 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way have joined the franchise’s lineup. Some stars appear on numerous series and have <a href=#>engaged in multiple relationships</a> on the shows, while others<a href=#> found lasting love their first time around</a>.</p><p>During an appearance on <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a> in May 2021, <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> revealed his love for the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. His favorite star? <a href=#><strong>Ed “Big Ed” Brown</strong></a>.</p><p>“I’m obsessed with all of them. I wouldn’t get freaked out if I saw&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>, but if I saw Big Ed walking down 6th Ave I would lose my f—king mind. I would go insane,” the King of Staten Island actor said.</p><p>Other celebs take their love for the series’ stars to another level. After <a href=#><strong>Larissa Dos Santos Lima</strong></a> announced her exit from 90 Day Fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Aaron Carter</strong> </a>took to <a href=#>Twitter</a> in October 2020 to advocate for her to get a raise.</p><p>“PAY YOUR CAST MORE!” he wrote to the official 90 Day Fiancé Twitter account.</p><p>Actress <a href=#><strong>Casey Wilson</strong></a> is another proud fan of the series. In March 2019, she wrote an essay about why people should watch the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“From the moment I saw a lovable wreck named [<a href=#><strong>Darcey Silva</strong></a>] scream over and over and over at her fiancé [<a href=#><strong>Jesse Meester</strong></a>], “CUT THE STEAK ON THE BIAS!!!!!!!!” I knew my life would never be the same,” the Happy Endings actress wrote for <a href=#>Glamour</a> at the time.</p><p>Scroll to see which celebs are fans of the series:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BYsq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mo6iulWKGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
