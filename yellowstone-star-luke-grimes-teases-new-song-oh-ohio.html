The short clip gives fans a preview of the kind of emotion we’ll all feel when we hear the song in full, while his sultry and soulful voice guides viewers through a series of video clips from somewhere special to Grimes.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Hailing from Ohio, Grimes’ latest single seems to hold a deep-seated honor and respect for the place that helped raise him and the childhood he knew.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Grimes (@lukegrimes)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>The lyrics so far prove that, much like his first tune, this one will evoke a heavy sense of emotion in listeners, one of longing for something from our past, something that shaped us, moved us, and allowed us to exist in the sense of joy while also causing us pain. What can we say? We’re ready.</p><p>“Oh, it’s been nice to know ya, guess it’s time I get on down the road — when you’re forgetting me, crucify my memory…know I bleed Ohio.”</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>In a chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Feelgood</a>, Grimes shares more about how growing up in Ohio set him up on a path to success for reasons he didn’t understand at the time.</p><p>“I grew up in Dayton, Ohio. I grew up very, very Christian. My dad was a pastor. So I went to Christian school, I went to Christian camp, I was very, very religious growing up. But I wouldn’t change it for anything. I grew up around some really awesome, kind people, and in a really nice, comfortable place. And there wasn’t much to do in Ohio except for sit around and try to get good at stuff, which I appreciate now.”</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Of course, it’s not just Ohio that Grimes reflects upon when looking at his childhood; it’s the influence of his parents and how grateful he is for the memories he has, especially since the passing of his father in February of 2022.</p><p>“Not having him here anymore made me really go back and hold on so dear to some of those memories. He taught me that you can be strong without having an ego, and you can be a leader and still be humble and still be kind.”</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>It goes without saying that “Oh Ohio” will be a sentimental tune for the ultra-talented Grimes, and we can’t wait to hear it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ieo6Wnp6jBsLrEZqqtmaJiuba3xGaeq6GdmsBuwMSaqp6rXaOyuHnSqKWgZZ%2BderC0yKhm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
