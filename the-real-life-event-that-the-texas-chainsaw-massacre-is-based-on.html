Gein is the progenitor of every modern serial killer stereotype. Fanatically religious mother with whom he lived until her death? Check. Taught from a young age about the evils of sex? Check. Asocial loner who stalked women resembling his <a href=#>late mother</a>? Check. Fascination with necrophilia and dissecting human bodies? Check.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, things get even more grotesque.&nbsp;Gein, born in 1906, worked as a handyman out of a farmhouse in Plainfield, Wisconsin, per <a href=#>Biography</a>.&nbsp;Over the years, several local women went missing, and the mystery of their disappearances came to a head on&nbsp;November 16, 1957, when Bernice Warden vanished from her hardware store, cash register gone, and a trail of blood leading out of the store. Her son, Frank Warden, happened to be deputy sheriff, and suspected that Gein was involved.&nbsp;When police arrived at Gein's house, they discovered a horrifying array of evidence regarding Gein's activities, including the&nbsp;decapitated corpse of Warden hanging upside in the kitchen, skulls used for bowls, lampshades and upholstery made from flesh, leggings and a corset made from skin, and nine skinned faces of women hanging on the bedroom wall. Gein evidently enjoyed wearing the skin of his victims, and pretending to be his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>And his late mother's room? In pristine, untouched condition. Gein spent his remaining years in mental institutions, before dying in 1984.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkmtuamhfqbWmedGemKVlnJ6zpnnEr5ynrF2ptaLAjK2fnmWkmsWiv4ycn5qhnqiuuHnMmqqsmZOnsm610maZmquVmXqwuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
