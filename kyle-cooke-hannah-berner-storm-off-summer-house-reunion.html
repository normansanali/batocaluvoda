Because it’s interesting how once the show aired and Twitter had their reactions, suddenly people were coming up with new conspiracies. … And it’s really snowballed.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kyle-Cooke-and-Hannah-Berner-Storm-Off-Summer-House-Reunion-Amid-Feud-Cast.jpg><p>Paige added that there wasn’t much mending of friendships.</p><p>“I think in terms of everyone’s friendships, I think they’re the same as when we left the house. I think people got a lot off their chest. I don’t think people heard each other,” she admitted. “I think everyone’s relationship is the same, but I feel like personally, people felt better because they got to say what they wanted to say. But I think everyone’s friendship is pretty much the same as where it was when we left the summer.”</p><p>Summer House airs on Bravo Thursdays at 9 p.m. The two-part reunion kicks off Thursday, April 29, at 9:15 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKypJVisLC7yp5koZmeo66pecGeqaedomLAtbvRpmSonpZiwLa5zJ6pZqCfqsCmedGerKehn6N8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
