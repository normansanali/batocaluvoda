It doesn’t affect you,” one<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> social media user wrote</a>. “The amount of trans hate in this thread is unreal.”</p><p>“Love Martha Stewart and Kim Petras,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another tweeted. </a>“Tired of men deciding what defines … beautiful women.”</p><p>One more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admired Petras </a>as “such a sweet soul.”</p><p>The musician told SI that being trans is not even the most important thing about her.</p><p>“I always try to remember that everything I do is definitely not about being transgender. It’s a part of me, but there are so many other parts of me,” the “Coconuts”&nbsp;singer sold SI. “And I think that’s really important for me to show that to people. No matter what your gender or sexuality or any of that stuff is, it’s about what you make of life and it’s about what’s inside of you, so I hope that can be inspiring to people.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Petras and singer Sam Smith made history after winning at the Grammy Awards this year. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Petras admitted it’s a “scary” time to be transgender in America. <span class=credit>Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency / MEGA</span></figure><p>Petras <a href=#>made history earlier in the year </a>at the 65th annual Grammy Awards, winning Best Pop Duo Performance with Sam Smith for their dance hit “Unholy.”</p><p>She was the first transgender woman to take home the award, and the second trans woman to win a Grammy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mam5fqL2wvtOsZKKknKrAtb7ArZydZZaWsKa%2FjJuYnKOclsCpecWoqWasopa7tLPEp5ueql2lvLF50q2Yq2WbnrpuvMStqZqrXajEqrnSrqCtZZOkw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
