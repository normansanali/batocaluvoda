So, what can we expect from their wedding special?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/emilia-bechrakis-ryan-serhant-wedding-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-2272992></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>We got to catch up with newlyweds <strong>Ryan Serhant</strong> and <strong>Emilia Bechrakis</strong> in NYC at Dogpound on Sept. 20 ahead of their Sept. 22 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Million Dollar Listing</a> wedding special, where they opened up about their gorgeous destination wedding, set in Corfu, Greece. “It’s like a big romantic comedy,” Ryan said of the celebration. “It’s going to be surprisingly very funny,” Emilia added, laughing. “It was a big, crazy Greek wedding with a lot of confused Americans,” Ryan joked.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While 150 of their close family and friends joined them for the gorgeous nuptials, the couple admitted wedding planning was anything but easy — a sentiment any engaged couple can definitely relate to. When asked if anything went awry leading up to the big day, Ryan said, “Yes, all of it!” “It was ridiculous, you almost won’t believe all the hiccups we went through, but you’ll have to watch,” Emilia added. “Anything that could go wrong, went wrong,” Ryan added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although we’ve seen so many of the gorgeous pictures from the big day, the couple admitted that there are a lot of “surprises” they can’t wait to share with viewers. “I’m excited for everyone to see it,” Emilia added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The beautiful bride selected a sleek, sexy and chic <strong>Romona Keveza</strong> gown for the special day and told us that she was actually planning on wearing another dress. “I chose it last minute because I had already chosen one of her dresses and I loved it and I saw it, [the wedding dress], hanging in the closet and I said, ‘Oh, can I try this on?’ and then I fell in love with it,” she said. “I had already gotten measured for my other dress and was about to put in the order and have it all set up and then last minute, it was a week later, I changed my mind. It was a few months before the wedding.”</p><h3>Celeb Brides That Didn’t Wear White</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Emilia also shared the inspiration behind the style. “I wanted a dress that felt like it represented me. I like more simple designs that incorporate detail,” she added. “I also realized in trying on a lot of different things that I didn’t really want a really white dress. Mine was off-white.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When it came to planning, Ryan was most excited to celebrate. “I wanted a really cool reception.” “He wanted a big party,” Emilia chimed in. “I did want a really big party. You know, it’s really far for people to come so I wanted everyone to just have a really good time and I think we pulled it off. It seems like so long ago and it took so long to plan, so it’s cool that we get to watch it again,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although the beaming newlyweds are looking forward to reliving the day when the special airs on Thursday, Emilia admitted that their televised special almost didn’t happen. “It was one of those things that I swore I would never do and in the end I said, ‘Okay, if I get to show Greece and I can show my traditions and culture,'” she said. “And we’ll be able to show it to our kids and their kids and their kids,” Ryan added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>From the ceremony to the reception, we can’t wait to watch Emilia and Ryan tie the knot! Be sure to tune into Bravo on Sept. 22 at 9PM EST to share in the couple’s special day on Million Dollar Listing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH16e5FqZp6lmaG2onnBnpqhqpGgtrR51p6bnaGenHqlvsSsqmaqqZa7br%2FEq5%2BapqRiuqq4y6Kmp2WUpLmtrdFmo6KrpJ67qHnGqK6nZaCesG65w6Wlsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
