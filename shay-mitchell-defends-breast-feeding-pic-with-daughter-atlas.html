Pls let me know where I can download your parenting manual, I’ll get right on it!”</p><p>Mitchell and her boyfriend,<a href=#> <strong>Matte Babel</strong></a>, announced <a href=#>their daughter’s birth in October</a> — but this isn’t the first time that the Bliss author has <a href=#>faced the parenting police</a>.</p><p>After the couple <a href=#>celebrated Drake’s 33rd birthday</a> later that same week, trolls bashed the decision. “I haven’t been really checking my comments that often, but apparently people are really upset that I left three days after having a kid to go out and party,” the Canadian actress said on her Instagram Story at the time. “It wasn’t three days and she was with [my dog] Angel, so…”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Shay-Mitchell-breast-feeding-2.jpg><p>Mitchell went on to write in the comments: “Just because I posted on that day doesn’t mean she was born on that day.”</p><p>She and the music journalist, 39, announced in June that they were expecting their first child after previously suffering a miscarriage. The <a href=#>You</a> alum told Us Weekly exclusively the following month that<a href=#> Babel had been spoiling her with “massages” throughout her pregnancy</a>.</p><p>“Not very long ones, but I’ll take them when I can get them,” Mitchell explained to Us. “He’s … supporting my wants to continue working throughout this whole process, so that’s always good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasoJGueq6105yfnqScYrGmssSnm6xlkqeyor%2FTZp2enZSeu6h5z6KaZq%2BZqbVusMCunqGslad6osDLmqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
