Last week, I was playing PlayStation with these guys. I spoke with Wenger, and he surprised me because he was taller than I expected.”</p><p>Recalling the meeting, Ibrahimovic said, “I entered his office, and we spoke. He wanted to know me, to understand me. I think he’s the type of person who doesn’t just buy a player; he wants to know what he’s getting. In the end, he had an Arsenal shirt with Number 9 and said, ‘We want you to come and do a trial for two weeks.’</p><p>“Everything seemed good until he mentioned the trial. I looked at him. Obviously, he was Wenger, and I was nobody at that moment. I said, ‘I don’t do trials.’ He asked, ‘What do you mean?’</p><p>“I replied, ‘I don’t do trials. Either you want me or you don’t. Otherwise, why am I here?'” Ibrahimovic explained. “That was my stance. It wasn’t about playing a game; it was about me. ‘No, but you have to come and do a trial.’ And I said, ‘No, no, you don’t understand, I don’t do trials.’ And that was it. I never went to Arsenal.”</p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmixpZmklrtutcGrmKGhnaTDqq%2BMq5yfpJWYwbR5zqdknKeeq7Kzv8CtoKimXay2tbSMsJynn5WneqK6w2aroZ1dm66quMSdZJqqo5q7oriMpqavnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
