I want my child to have all they need, like a school, food, clothes, toys.”</p><p>Chantel reassured Pedro that their children would have those things, and he added, “It’s very important to me. I want to be the best father in the world.”</p><p>For now, Pedro is focusing on bringing his family to the United States from the Dominican Republic. “They have the good life here in the United States,” he told Us. “The better life.”</p><p>Not only does Pedro find America to be more “accessible,” but he noted that his mom is getting older. “I want to be close to my mom and try to put her in a comfortable space,” he explained. “In the same way we can go weekends to see her mom, I [want] to do things with [my] family.”</p><p>The <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a>alums met and fell in love when Chantel took a trip to the Dominican Republic, and they got engaged in secret.
