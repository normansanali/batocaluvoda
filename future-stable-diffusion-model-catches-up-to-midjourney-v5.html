This leaves questions on exactly what Stability AI has planned for the update.</p><p>However, from what the post revealed, the new model succeeds the Stable Diffusion XL version that was released in April and will focus on improving hand generation and overall “image and composition detail,” according to Bloomberg.</p><p>The blog post includes sample images generated from the same prompts to show the improvement in quality between the Stable Diffusion XL beta and SDXL 0.9, with the brand saying that the new model stands as “a leap in creative use cases for generative AI imagery.” Some of the prompts include aliens, a wolf, and a person holding a coffee cup.</p><p>The upcoming SDXL 0.9 update also follows the <a href=#>Midjourney v5 rollout</a> launched in March, which also focused on improving hand generation. Midjourney AI develops its own proprietary models and has a similar issue where earlier models often generated with an incorrect number of digits on hands, anywhere from four to between seven and 10 on human subjects.</p><p>PC compatibility for SDXL 0.9 includes a minimum of 16GB of <a href=# data-injected=1>RAM</a> and a GeForce RTX 20 (or higher) <a href=# data-injected=1>graphics card</a> with 8GB of VRAM, in addition to a <a href=# data-injected=1>Windows 11</a>, Windows 10, or Linux operating system. The model is expected to work through Stability AI’s Clipdrop web tool and will also be added to the company’s DreamStudio app. As per the deleted blog post, there will also be an open-source SDXL 1.0 version. It said this version would launch in mid-July, but now this date is uncertain.</p><p>Stable Diffusion is also the source code behind many popular AI image generators, including Starry AI and Night Cafe. Once the SDXL 0.9 update becomes available, it will likely benefit the other partner generators as well.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX5vCtcHRnmSsrJGXuaZ5w6Kdn62jnryvecyom56kXZiuta%2FHnqpmraBiwbB5zKKbo6elp7umxYyvbGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
