After 20 years in business, Scoop closed all of its 16 stores in May, due partially to consumers’ preference for activewear instead of designer sportswear.</p><p>Knowing many Hamptonites are big on exercise, Sweaty Betty has been scouting a location on the East End for a while. The location, which will be open through Labor Day, will feature British design accents in respect to the London-based label. Along with hoodies, printed tanks and sleeveless tanks imported with “Life’s A Beach,” the shop will also sell swimwear and wetsuits for surfers, stand-up paddle-boarders, kayakers and beachgoers alike. There will also be a lounge area to try to encourage shoppers to linger and leaf through a London city guide and fashion-leaning coffee table books. The East Hampton shop will also be the first U.S. store to have the fall collection so that shoppers can get a jump on the season.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title a-font-primary-regular-s lrv-u-margin-t-00 lrv-u-margin-b-075 lrv-u-color-black">Related Articles</h3><p>Founded in 1998 by Tamara Hill-Norton and later joined by her husband Simon Hill-Norton, Sweaty Betty has 40 stores in the U.K. and six in the U.S., as well as concept shops in Harrods, Selfridges, Bloomingdale’s and others. With outposts for SoulCycle, Flywheel, Yoga Shanti, SLT, Anna Kaiser’s AKT InMotion, Barry’s Bootcamp (in three locations,) Yoga Lila and Xtend Barre and miles of beachfront, the area is prime for fitness enthusiasts.</p><p>A Sweaty Betty spokeswoman said, “We are still currently looking into events to host at our store and/or to be a part of in the East Hampton community. We also have great relationships with all the studios, such as AKT and are looking to do some sort of small-scale partnership with them this summer.”</p><p>While Tory Burch, Kelly Ripa and&nbsp;Hilaria Baldwin are among the athletically inclined members of the summer crowd, there are scores of others who consider shopping to be a sufficient workout. And Sweaty Betty joins a competitive <a href=# id=auto-tag_retail-2 data-tag=retail-2>retail</a> scene, which includes Juju Active, Bandier, J. Crew and Set Point Tennis. The latter is the new incarnation of Tennis East owned by tennis pro Ricardo Winter and his wife Lisa Herbert-Winter, Pantone’s former executive vice president for Fashion & Home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp5l7pLvMaJ2emaSqv6Z70rCcmqypYq%2BmwNOyZK2nXaS9prqMqaapZaWlerS0zqlkoqZdmq60wIyhmKaopKS7brvNZqGupKlifnGAl2xqamhf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
