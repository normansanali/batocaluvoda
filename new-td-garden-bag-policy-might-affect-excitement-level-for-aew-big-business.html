While millions of AEW fans around the world expect to have an amazing night, the new bag policy from the TD Garden might limit things.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>The newest bag policy from arena </a>states that no bags bigger that 4in x 6in x 1.5in will be allowed in the arena. In addition to that, backpacks and oversized bags are also prohibited as per the new policies. However, bags purchased from the Boston ProShop are welcome into the arena.&nbsp;</p><p>This adds a lot of limitations of what fans can take in and how much is allowed into the arena. Though not a lot would change, fans might have to stay back from taking some of their favorite stuff, heading into AEW Big Business in three weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>AEW Big Business is set to be hosted with a 5,882 seating capacity with more than 4500 already sold. Thanks to rumours of Sasha Banks making her debut at the event, the excitement is building up.
