Discovery Channel's Shark Week 2015 is still months away — mark your calendars for July — but as Tracy Jordan once said on 30 Rock, we should live every week like it's shark week. And what better way to celebrate than with a spine-chilling shark pic?</p><p>A stunning (and terrifying) photo made the rounds online this week, showing a photographer getting up close and very personal with a jaw-dropping (in more ways than one!) great white shark near Australia. In it, the photog holds a camera partly submerged in the water while perched on a metal platform, as the shark surfaces and opens wide just a few feet away.</p><p>The pic, it turns out, is part of Discovery's upcoming Shark Week lineup. On Friday, May 8, the network released some backstory about the shot, as well as a new promo for Shark Week 2015, which kicks off on July 5.</p><p></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We'd just come back from Port Lincoln in South Australia, and while we were over there, we ran into one of the most remarkable animals I've ever seen," filmmaker Dave Riggs says in the clip. "It was a female great white. She was around four and a half meters in length, and extremely inquisitive of what we were and what we were doing."</p><p>Footage of the shark shows her sniffing around Riggs' boat and equipment, at times baring her giant teeth. "Of course, great whites don't have hands, so she was researching the area the only way she knows how, and that's with her mouth," he explains. "So this photo is quite dramatic, but it really highlights how awesome these apex predators are."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGnuG7DxJ6iZmpgZoJus9GemK1lp522tbGMqaCcZaeeua15zJqinmWppMKzecmarmacoqS9bn6PamxxbV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
