He was taken to the hospital in serious condition and died and short time later.</p><p>His family said Laidley was a 9/11 survivor, and was working in Tower Two when the attack happened. It was just his second day on the job.</p><p>His family released the following statement:</p><p><i>Born on September 14, 1979, Luke Laidley was the fifth of six kids to Forrest and Diane Laidley of Libertyville, IL. Raised in the northern suburbs of Chicago, Luke was an avid athlete and grounded himself in faith as a graduate of Carmel Catholic High School in Mundelein and Boston College where the tenant philosophy was to serve as men and women for others.</i></p><p>After graduating from Boston College with a degree in Finance, he took his first job at 21 years old with Morgan Stanley in New York City. Morgan Stanley was the largest tenant in Tower 2 of the World Trade Center. His second day on the job was September 11, 2001. As a survivor of the 61th floor of Tower 2, he later wrote, “I encourage all of us to count our blessings each and every day. Give of yourself and expect nothing in return. And become part of something that is greater than yourself.”</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
