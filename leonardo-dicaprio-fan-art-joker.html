As it so happens, it looks like the studio may have actually listened, as it’s now since been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Warner Bros. are targeting DiCaprio</a> as their first choice for the role.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>So, what would the Oscar-winning star look like as Batman’s nemesis? If you’re struggling to imagine Leo’s handsome face caked with pale make-up and sporting bright green hair, then have no fear, as we have something to help you out. Digital fan artist Boss Logic has mocked up an image of what the actor could look like as the iconic supervillain, and you can check it out down below.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/DIqcu17W4AAYimj.jpg alt width=1000 height=694 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>All things considered, it’s an effective piece, with a toned-down aesthetic that could suit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the “gritty” direction</a>&nbsp;that the Joker origins movie is said to be headed in. The Heath Ledger-alike slit mouth is likely to be close to the version of the character’s&nbsp;grin depicted in the film, too, as one report’s claimed that the movie will show&nbsp;Mr. J with “a permanent smile.”</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>The cracked, flaking skin is a nice original touch as well. While we don’t have any evidence suggesting that this is something that will be implemented, it is a fresh way of approaching the Joker’s disfigurement and could work well if it made it to the big screen.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=false>While the artwork above is very enticing, it’s important to remember that we’re far from having DiCaprio locked in to play the part. Warner Bros. are allegedly in early talks with the actor, but nothing’s set in stone just yet. Having said that, hopefully the presence of DiCaprio’s old collaborator Scorsese will&nbsp;convince him to take the job and hop on board&nbsp;<strong>The Joker</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo56nnpa%2FpbuMnaCcmaCntrB5xZqlZpmiqXqru8qeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
