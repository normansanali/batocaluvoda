If this is your first time hearing about this story, allow me to tell you a bit about Kagurabachi and Chihiro Rokuhira.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-chihiro-rokuhira-from-kagurabachi data-injectable=false>Who is Chihiro Rokuhira from Kagurabachi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kagurabachi.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>Obviously, each story has its protagonist. In Kagurabachi‘s case, the manga is led by its main force, Chihiro Rokuhira. We meet him as a 14-year-old teenager diligently training alongside his father, an infamous swordsmith. Hoping to follow in his father’s footsteps, Chihiro finds himself to be quite different from his kin, with his serious nature evidently contrasting with his dad’s – who enjoys talking with his goldfish.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>We see Chihiro once more later in the chapter, but only, he looks entirely different. It is unveiled that three years have passed since we first saw the teen, and quite a lot has happened. He is naturally older, but he also now has a scar on his face. We see him hunting down a mysterious group of sorcerers, later known to be called “Hishaku,” and his hatred is palpable throughout the pages.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>It is probably safe to assume the group likely did something to his beloved father – but we just don’t know it quite yet. That’s just my guess, considering most Shonen have some sort of daddy issue. But of course, only one chapter is out so very little is known. Still, plenty of Shounen Jump fans have their sights ready on the next chapter, and so do I.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=false>So if you want to read the first chapter of Kagurabachi, head on to Shonen Jump to get your fix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6tbTEZqSaoZ5isKmt0ZqarZ2iYrynecqanq6qkZeupLTIaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
