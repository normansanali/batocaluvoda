After more than two years together, Patrick’s rep told Us in July 2020 that the duo <a href=#>were “no longer together.”</a> News of the breakup came days after the Wisconsin native unfollowed Aaron on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Danica-Patrick-Helped-Mend-Aaron-Rodgers-Family-Rift-Before-Split.jpg><p>Before they called it quits, the Super Bowl MVP’s family drama took a toll on the “Pretty Intense” podcast host. “It was tough for her to be in a relationship with somebody who’s not close to his family,” the source adds. “But she was there for him no matter what.”</p><p>It’s still unclear what caused the rift between the NFL star and his younger brother, 32, who hinted that he doesn’t keep in close contact with Aaron during <a href=#>season 12 of The Bachelorette</a> in 2016. Luke Rodgers, the eldest sibling, also didn’t shy away from discussing the state of their family dynamic.</p><p>“It pains both of us, like, not to have that relationship [with Aaron] – we miss our brother,” Luke said when Jordan returned for his hometown date now-fiancée <a href=#><strong>JoJo Fletcher</strong></a>. “I trust that God brings things full circle and that everything would just get back to us being a family.”</p><p>At the time, Aaron told a local news station that <a href=#>he found it “a little inappropriate”</a> for his family to discuss personal matters on national TV. “I’m not going to speak on those things, but I wish him well in the competition,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Danica-Patrick-Helped-Mend-Aaron-Rodgers-Family-Rift-Before-Split-2.jpg><p>Following his split from Patrick, the quarterback moved on with <a href=#><strong>Shailene Woodley</strong></a>. Us confirmed in February that they were <a href=#>officially an item</a> after they were first linked last summer. The same month, the Big Little Lies actress, 29, told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> that she and Aaron <a href=#>had been engaged “for a while.”</a></p><p>“We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar,” Woodley said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn’t know, like, what kind of a football guy he was. And I’m still constantly learning.”</p><p>As the pair dive into wedding planning, Aaron’s complicated relationship with his siblings has prompted plenty of questions.</p><p>“Aaron is still thinking about which family members to invite. It’s <a href=#>something that’s weighing heavily</a> on him,” a second source exclusively revealed earlier this month. “It’ll for sure be a special day and it would be wrong of him to not invite his family. … Whether they decide to come [is] up to them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Patrick, for her part, <a href=#>isn’t rushing</a> to find The One. “She’s single at the moment and she’s enjoying life,” the first source says, noting that the ex-NASCAR racer “has completely moved on” from her previous relationship. “She doesn’t have any thoughts about Aaron and Shailene. … She believes in moving forward in life, not looking back in the past.”</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6esKJ5z5qrq6GToHqpscupnJ1lnZq7pXnAmqmopl2nvKWzxKuqZp6RoratxYyroJ%2BsXZeyp7vRnmSsqJyewXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
