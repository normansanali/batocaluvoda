His first season as head coach led the Panthers to a 5-11 record; his second season brought a 5-12 record.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Discontent had been growing among Panthers fans, as Sunday’s game drew a large crowd of 49ers fans, along with boos from many Carolina followers. During a news conference Monday afternoon, Panthers owner David Tepper acknowledged that a change had to be made after Sunday.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“There might have been a little bit of loss of intensity on the field yesterday. I would say that’s probably evident versus the first four games,” Tepper told reporters, including Channel 9′s Phil Orban. “I have great respect for the fans and I do hear the fans, but ultimately, those that can’t be a reason why you make a change like this. But again, there’s numerous reasons why you make a change like this.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Less than 24 hours after quarterback Baker Mayfield was spotted in a boot following the loss, Rhule was booted from the Panthers organization.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">After Sunday’s game, players got emotional talking about Rhule in the locker room.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“All that stuff I heard today, you know, from fans and boos, all the red and ‘fire Rhule,’ and all that, he’s a strong cat, you feel me? And he’s got my respect ‘cause he don’t let that faze him. And he’s still coming in front of us here today to talk. And I’ve got respect for him,” Brian Burns said.</p><span class="styled__PlaybackText-sc-1kcr3bh-5 ljtSBk">Expand</span><span aria-label="Start automatic slide show" class="styled__PlaybackText-sc-1kcr3bh-5 ljtSBk">Autoplay</span><span class="styled__ImageCountText-sc-1kcr3bh-6 vxLtI"><span class=sr-only>Image</span> 1 of 20</span><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 gAFIWJ image-metadata"><span class=title>49ers Panthers Football </span><span>Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule reacts during the first half an NFL football game against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, Oct. 9, 2022, in Charlotte, N.C.
