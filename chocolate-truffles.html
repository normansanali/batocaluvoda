I have a confession — I pretty much eat chocolate every single day of my life and I am happy about it. By the time it hits 3:00, I am wondering where my chocolate is for the day.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chocolate-Truffles-5-720x664.jpg alt="Chocolate Truffles.

It is so much fun to discover hidden gems. When we visited Seattle, we even took a chocolate tour at Theo Chocolates to see how it is made and it was the epitome of a perfect day for me. Oh, and did I tell you about the unlimited samples?</p><p>It is almost Valentine’s Day so I want to share how easy it is to make homemade chocolate truffles at home! It is actually shocking how easy it is and they are so decadent.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chocolate-Truffles-6-720x763.jpg alt="Chocolate Truffles.

You may want to add extracts to give extra flavor such as vanilla, strawberry, raspberry, orange, coconut, mint, etc. You can roll them into toppings after they chill in the refrigerator.</p><p>Do not substitute anything for the heavy cream. The chocolate truffles will not set up properly without the heavy cream.</p><h2>What type of chocolate should I use when making Chocolate Truffles?</h2><p>I suggest using the highest-quality chocolate you can get your hands on. I suggest buying Ghirardelli or Guittard baking bars or Lindt chocolate bars. There are other brands such as Theo Chocolate, Private Selection, and other fine chocolatiers. You can also find Swiss chocolate bars imported from Switzerland. If you want extra luxurious and decadent truffles, reach for semi-sweet or dark chocolate. If you want sweeter truffles, reach for milk chocolate. I prefer to do a mix of the two of them.</p><p>Do NOT use chocolate chips as they will not melt smooth enough.</p><p>DO NOT use the chocolate melting wafers. This chocolate has added oils to it to add it melting so it will not be firm enough for scooping and rolling chocolate truffles. The chocolate melting wafers are perfect for dipping your chocolate truffles in.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chocolate-Truffles-1-crop-720x868.jpg alt="Chocolate Truffles.
