"Ryan has always liked me independent. He's never said: 'Don't do it.' He is truly supportive. He is truly supportive, raises [our son] Redmond as much as I do, brings him to the set when I'm working, runs lines with me at home, doesn't view my acting as a threat," she gushed to the <a href=#>Sun Sentinel</a> in 1989. Yet, while the pair seemed perfect on paper, the two made headlines in 1997 when Fawcett broke up with O'Neal after catching him in bed with actor Leslie Ann Stefanson. "No [Farrah wasn't angry], she was hurt. She was in shock," O'Neal revealed in 2013, per <a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, the "Paper Moon" star gave further insight into the breakdown of their relationship, citing his bad attitude and menopause as factors. "I believe Farrah was going through some kind of change. I didn't have a change of life; I was always a jerk," he told the publication. "But they're hard work, these divas; I was sick of it, and I was unappreciated. I just don't think she liked me very much. So I excused myself." He went on to say that his infidelity had a huge impact on Fawcett, adding, "I watched her life disintegrate."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxma4R6fo6fmKuqkZ16p63WnJytrF2nxqK6jKilnpmcYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
