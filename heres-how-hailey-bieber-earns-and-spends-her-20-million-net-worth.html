Hailey entered the modeling industry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2014</a> and ever since she's been one of the big names in the fashion industry. Alongside her besties such as Kendall Jenner and the Hadid sisters, Hailey has taken over the industry by storm. Over the years the model has worked with plenty of famous brands such as Guess, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-luxurious-properties><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Spends: Luxurious Properties</span></h2><p>Just like most rich and famous — one thing that Hailey Bieber tends to spend quite a lot of money on are properties. Last year she and her husband, Canadian musician Justin Bieber bought a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25.8 million mansion</a> in the mountains above Beverly Hills within the illustrious Beverly Park. This surely won't be the last house that the couple decides to purchase as celebs tend to switch their properties rather quickly.</p><h2 id=earns-youtube-channel><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Earns: Youtube Channel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A recent source of income for Hailey Bieber is surely her YouTube channel which the model launched in March 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Here’s How Bella Thorne Earns And Spends Her $12 Million Net Worth" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Bella Thorne Earns And Spends Her $12 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>So far, Hailey's channel features plenty of lifestyle, beauty, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fashion videos</a> — and it gives Hailey's fans a glimpse into what the star is actually like behind the scenes. Currently, Hailey Bieber's YouTube channel has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1.13 million subscribers</a> — but the number is bound to grow even more in the future.</p><h2 id=spends-traveling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Spends: Traveling</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While traveling is definitely a big part of Hailey Bieber's work as she tends to model all across the globe — those who follow the star on social media definitely know that Hailey also loves traveling for her own soul. Together with her husband Justin Bieber, Hailey often goes on romantic getaways and while the two certainly seem down to earth, there's no doubt that their vacations cost a lot!</p><h2 id=earns-starring-in-music-videos><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Earns: Starring In Music Videos</span></h2><p>Because Hailey Bieber is an ultra-successful model, it's definitely not surprising that she has a couple of popular music videos under her belt. Over the course of her career, Hailey could be seen in quite a few music videos and her most notable ones are "On My Mind" by Cody Simpson, "Love to Love You Baby" by Baptiste Giabiconi, "10,000 Hours" by Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber, "Stuck with U" by Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, and "PopStar" by DJ Khaled, Drake, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-expensive-skincare><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Spends: Expensive Skincare</span></h2><p>Of course, because Hailey Bieber is such a successful model it's very important for her to maintain healthy and good-looking skin.

In total, her skincare products certainly add up to a couple of hundred dollars — but the model can&nbsp;definitely afford splurging on skincare.</p><h2 id=earns-hosting><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Earns: Hosting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another very common source of income for Hailey Bieber is doing work as a hostess.

In 2016 she collaborated with the clothing brand The Daily Edited as well as the footwear brand Public Desire. Hailey has also dabbled in the makeup industry with the Australian brand ModelCo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spends-her-dog><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Spends: Her Dog</span></h2><p>And finally, wrapping the list up is the fact that loves spoiling her and Justin's dog Oscar which the couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adopted in December 2018</a>.
