Her fans love this about her since it makes her feel more accessible than some closed-off celebrities. While she has said a lot about having M.S., there's a bit of mystery surrounding her first marriage. Here's the truth about why Jamie-Lynn Sigler and AJ Discala's marriage didn't work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-jamie-lynn-sigler-and-aj-discala-get-divorced>Why Did Jamie-Lynn Sigler And AJ Discala Get Divorced?</h2><p>While The Sopranos cast member <a href=#>Robert Iler disappeared from the spotlight</a>, Jamie-Lynn Sigler is as famous now as she was when fans saw her on the HBO drama for the first time. But even though she is a beloved public figure, her fans might not know that much about her first marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-real-reason-jamie-lynn-sigler-and-her-first-husband-aj-discala-got-divorced.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie-Lynn Sigler and AJ Discala were married</a> from 2003 to 2005. According to Forbes, she was only 22 years old at the time, and he was 32.</p><p>There isn't a lot of information about the couple's relationship or what it was like for the actress when they broke up. However, according to the Arizona Daily Star, the fact that Discala was ten years older than Sigler caused issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/aj-discala-jamie-lynn-sigler.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sigler hasn't explained why her first marriage ended, this does sound possible. She was only 16 when she began playing Meadow Soprano on The Sopranos. Since the TV series aired from 1999 to 2007, she was still filming the series at the time of her divorce.</p><p>As she approached her mid-20s, it's plausible that she realized that this wasn't the right relationship for her and she wanted to be on her own. This is just speculation, though.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Untitled-design---2022-02-08T222223888.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Playing Tony Soprano Took A Toll On James Gandolfini Behind The Scenes">Playing Tony Soprano Took A Toll On James Gandolfini Behind The Scenes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Portaying Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini's life became very dark when cameras weren't rolling.</p><p>Although not much is known about Sigler's first marriage, The New York Post reported in 2005 that Discala and Nick Lachey were spending time together when both of their marriages broke up around the same time. It seems that the two were friends, at least during that time period. Sigler is also credited in an episode of Lachey and Jessica Simpson's MTV reality series Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Entertainment Weekly reported that AJ Discala and Jamie-Lynn Sigler were together for two years prior to getting married.

While Sigler was in a relationship with Discala, she was dealing with a difficult health issue, and dealing with it must have taken up a lot of her time.</p><p>In 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie-Lynn Sigler talked about having Multiple Sclerosis</a> on The Today Show and explained that she decided not to mention it publicly for 15 years.

She said, "I went through a divorce. It was a very stressful time. That's when things started to manifest. I started to have some issues with my gait, I started to have bladder incontinence again, things that were very uncomfortable and scary. I panicked."</p><p>She continued, "People didn't talk about things being wrong back then... We were still in this mentality like 'Everything's perfect, everything's fine.'"

My oldest son is an empath. He’s very sensitive. If I ever apologize [to] him that I can’t do certain things or explain to him certain limitations I have, he’s always like, ‘Oh mom, I get it, don’t worry. It’s all right.’” she shares. “My little one … He is upset about it, he doesn’t like it.
