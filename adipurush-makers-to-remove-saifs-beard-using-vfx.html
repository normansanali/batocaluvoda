Amid the movie lovers who anticipated the real action epic and also the folks who did not like the look of Raavan and Hanuman in the beard, the Adipurush director and team are intending to pacify at least some of them.</p><p>Saif’s look with beard and buzz cut received a lot of criticism while Hanuman’s character is seen wearing leather straps. Saif Ali Khan will be seen as Raavan, but the beard look attracted huge criticism from all corners saying that his look is hurting religious sentiments.</p><p>If the reports are anything to go by, Adipurush makers are underway to give a makeover to Raavan’s look. As it is not an easy task to reshoot all the parts of Raavan in the movie, the makers are heard to be relying on the VFX team to remove Saif’s beard.</p><p>The director Om Raut later tried to justify the look of Raavan that it was made to stay relevant to the current generation who mostly know the bad guys in that sort of look. With the rumors already on a rampage that they are pouring in 100 crores more for the betterment of the graphics work, netizens started trolling on how much of it is going towards Saif’s digital shave.</p><p>Adipurush is being made on a budget of more than 450 crore rupees and this said additional 100 cr is making it one of the most expensive Indian films. The makers postponed the release from January to June 16, 2023.</p><p>‘Adipurush is not a film, but a representation of our devotion to Prabhu Shri Ram and our commitment to our Sanskriti and history. To give a complete visual experience to the viewers, we need to give more time to the teams working on the film. Adipurush will now release on June 16th, 2023. We are committed to making a film that India will be proud of. Your support, love, and blessings are what keep us going,’ wrote Om Raut while announcing the postponement.</p><p>Prabhas will be seen in the lead role as Rama and Kriti Sanon is playing Sita.</p><p class=post-tag>Tags <a href=# rel=tag>Saif Ali Khan Adipurush</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxzfZBsamtnkZm2scHRrqqhZZ2WuKa%2B0marqGWimrqwwsRmqpqhlqh6o7HAq5tmraOeu6h51Z%2Bv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
